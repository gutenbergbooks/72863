<small>ON SIX TOWN POND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Have you tried the fishing this summer?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve been too busy on the farm.
This is the first day I have had when I could get
away.”</p>

<p>“It looks like rain. Is that the reason why you’ve
dropped the shovel and the hoe?”</p>

<p>“Partly. It’s more though, for the two dollars
a day you’ve agreed to pay me for rowing you over
the pond. I can’t pick that up on the farm, you
know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be a rich man if you don’t look out.
Ever thought what you’d do with all your money?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve thought a good lot about it. Perhaps
‘thinking’ about it is as far as I’ll ever get
with it.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to invest it?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get enough to help me go to school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Walter Borden sat quietly erect in the stern of
the rude skiff in which he was seated, lazily holding
a rod in his hands from which a long line was
paid out in the hope that some stray pickerel in Six
Town Pond might be tempted by the bait displayed.</p>

<p>A half-hour before the time when the conversation
recorded above had taken place he and his companion,
Dan Richards, had driven seven miles from
the home of Walter’s grandfather, for the day,
which was to be devoted to fishing in the pond, that
extended three miles in length and in places was a
mile or more wide. The little body of water was
well known in the region for the fish which were
said to be found in its depths, and Walter was convinced
that the reports were not exaggerated, for
in numerous summers preceding the one when this
story opens he had tested the fact with varying
degrees of success.</p>

<p>Every summer Walter came from his home in
New York to spend at least a part of his vacation
on the farm of his Grandfather Sprague. The broad
acres, the great roomy barns, the cattle and horses,
the deep brook that sped swiftly through the pasture,
even the old-fashioned farmhouse with its garret
and its broad piazzas, to say nothing of the
many low rooms with their numerous windows, had
every one a place dear to Walter’s heart. From his
earliest recollections, here was the place where his
summer days had been passed. So eager was he to
come, that when he was only ten years old his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
father and mother had yielded to his pleadings and
seen him safely entrusted to the conductor and
porter of the sleeping-car, and alone he had gone
on the journey of three hundred miles to Rodman,
the little village a half-mile distant from Grandfather
Sprague’s home. It is true this is the form
which Walter took to describe the place, although
an ordinary observer would have said that the
Sprague farm was half a mile from the village.</p>

<p>Later in the summer Mrs. Borden came to join
her boy and pay her annual visit to her father
and mother. Her words of wonderment, when
she arrived, at the change in her boy’s appearance
since he had left home did not vary much
from year to year. The tanned cheeks, the firmer
muscles, the keen appetite, that made Grandfather
Sprague shake his head as the cook’s johnny-cakes
disappeared twice a day almost as silently as the
dew from the shaded lawn, were an annual delight
to Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“Beats all how much a boy can hold,” Grandfather
Sprague daily would say as he watched the
hungry lad.</p>

<p>Those days were gone now, for Walter Borden
was a well-grown muscular boy of sixteen. “I
haven’t a doubt that I can put you on the bed
yet,” laughed his grandfather, his eyes twinkling
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“You’d better not try it,” laughed Walter’s
mother, glancing in pride at her boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“Come on, grandfather,” Walter would call out
laughingly; “try it!”</p>

<p>“‘Try it’!” retorted Grandfather Sprague.
“I’m not going to ‘try’ it; I’m going to do it!”</p>

<p>“When?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“One time is as good as another.”</p>

<p>“Do it now! Do it now!” retorted the lad.</p>

<p>“You’re nothing but a little whipper-snapper.
You don’t weigh more than a hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“How much do you weigh, grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and ten.”</p>

<p>“All right. You have the advantage in weight.
I’ll not count it though, if you’ll put me on the bed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try it, pa,” spoke up Grandmother
Sprague. “You might slip and break your leg.”</p>

<p>“Or hurt his pride,” laughed Walter, whose love
and respect for his grandfather were almost as
keen as was the old man’s love for the stalwart lad.</p>

<p>“Pooh, ma,” the old gentleman retorted a trifle
testily. “You don’t suppose I’m so old I can’t take
my own grandson across my lap and spank him
as he deserves, do you?”</p>

<p>“You might if he would lie still,” replied Mrs.
Sprague dryly. “But you and I were born on the
same day and so I know just how old you are.
You are seventy-seven——”</p>

<p>“And almost as spry as ever I was,” broke in
her husband. “I don’t feel a day older than when
I was forty. The only thing that troubles me any
is that I stub my toe more than I used to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“You take my advice and don’t bother with
Walter.”</p>

<p>“Well, to please you, ma, I’ll give him a day of
grace. But I give you fair warning,” he would add
turning to the laughing boy, “that to-morrow at
ten-thirty I shall give you what you deserve.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at ten-thirty,” brought a daily repetition
of the scene and conversation and not yet
had Grandfather Sprague found just the time for
displaying his prowess. His deep love for Walter
was a source of joy to his grandson, who almost
revered his portly, jolly, devout grandfather. His
happiest days were those spent on the farm, and
next to them were the visits of his grandfather
and grandmother to the city.</p>

<p>According to Grandfather Sprague, all the members
of the family were in a conspiracy to “spoil
the boy,” that is, all except himself. He was for
letting the boy know his proper place. But if anyone
had ever heard of Grandfather Sprague refusing
a request of Walter, or failing to be the first to
herald his success in school or on the athletic field,
he had held his peace so successfully that none had
ever heard his testimony.</p>

<p>Every spot and creature on the farm were known
to Walter. He had tramped in the woods, fished
in the brooks, ridden the horses, driven the cows
from the pasture to the barns—in fact, in former
years the only moments when he had not been busy
had been those when his tired little body was asleep.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
The collie and the horse which had been given him
brought Walter’s life a little more closely into
touch with animate things, but his chief interest
aside from his grandfather’s place was in Dan
Richards, who lived with his widowed mother and
his brother Tom—a year and a half older than Dan—on
the little farm adjoining.</p>

<p>Dan’s skill in making whistles of the willows,
his unusual strength, his quiet bearing had appealed
strongly to Walter in other days. Even now, when
both were older and Dan’s lack of money was as
marked as was Walter’s freedom in its use and
disregard of its true value, there was a similar
feeling of regard in Walter’s heart. The dark eyes,
the tall form, the quiet unassuming ways of Dan
were still almost as strong in their appeal to Walter
as were the undoubted possession of physical
strength and skill which were Dan’s. The quiet
manner in which Dan had accepted his friend’s
offer to pay him for rowing on the pond had deceived
Walter completely. His blue eyes, his light-brown
hair, his well-knit muscular body—“stocky”
Dan called him, were not in sharper contrast to
Dan’s physical characteristics than were their differences
in mind and temper. The offer to “employ”
his old friend had meant little to Walter.
How much of an effort it had been for Dan to
accept he never for a moment even suspected. Even
his expression of surprise when he looked up hastily,
as Dan explained how he hoped to invest his earnings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
did not have in it one glance of understanding.
Dan and the little “Rockland Farm,” which,
with the best of care, provided only a scanty living
for its owners, were almost inseparable in Walter’s
mind. That Dan had ambitions beyond the limits
of his farm or even beyond the little village of
Rodman had not once occurred to Walter.</p>

<p>“School, Dan?” he exclaimed in surprise as he
looked at his companion.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dan quietly, without glancing at
the fisherman.</p>

<p>“What put that into your head?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever heard of a fellow wanting
to get an education?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, of course,” said Walter, “but I hadn’t
thought——”</p>

<p>“Of me in that connection?” suggested Dan as
his friend hesitated.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I shouldn’t think of it,”
said Walter hastily.</p>

<p>“But the fact is you hadn’t?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. What are your plans?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have any very definite
‘plans,’ as you call them. Last year there was a
young fellow from college that taught our school.
I guess he put it into my head. He seemed to be
interested, and gave me some lessons every night
after I had finished my chores.”</p>

<p>“In what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, in algebra and Latin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“And you have been working on them?”</p>

<p>“A little. I had to be busy on the farm all
day, and nights were the only times I had free.”</p>

<p>“Where do you plan to go?”</p>

<p>“I had been thinking some of going to the Normal
School at Jericho. That’s only forty miles from
here. It won’t cost very much there, you know.
If I can get a little money ahead, I’m going to try
it anyhow,” Dan said quietly.</p>

<p>“Going on to college?”</p>

<p>“I should like to. The hardest thing is to leave
my mother and Tom to run the farm. They need
me and I don’t know that they really can get along
without me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they want you to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mother says she’ll sell or mortgage the
farm and go with me, if Tom will go too. She’d
get a few rooms and perhaps take a few boarders
and help us that way.”</p>

<p>“Your mother is all right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know that?”</p>

<p>“You ought to, if any one does——”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a strike,” broke in Dan quietly.
“Better pay attention to your fishing, that is, if you
want to get any fish.”</p>

<p>Conversation ceased as Walter sharply yanked his
rod. “The fish got away!” he exclaimed with
chagrin a minute later.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Dan dryly. “What did you
expect? You pulled the hook right out of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
mouth. You don’t think a pickerel will hang on
with his fins and tail, do you?”</p>

<p>“Show me how, Dan,” said Walter humbly. “I
believe I’ve forgotten how to do it.”</p>

<p>“No, you haven’t. You never knew how, so you
haven’t forgotten. Hold on! You’ve got another
strike! Hand me your rod and I’ll try to show you
how to handle a strike.”</p>

<p class="cap">Dan took the light rod and instantly let out a
few feet of the line. He dropped his oars as
he did so and the skiff swung around before the
gentle breeze that was blowing. Intently watching
the line, he permitted the tip of the rod to drop
back until it was even with the stern of the boat,
and then with one strong yank he swung it back
until it was again at a right angle with the skiff.</p>

<p>“Take your rod,” he said quietly, as he handed
it to his companion. “Your pickerel is hooked all
right; now let me see you land it. Be careful
of your slack,” he added quickly, as Walter began
to reel in swiftly.</p>

<p>The oars were again grasped by Dan, and he
slowly sent the boat ahead, meanwhile watching his
companion in the latter’s efforts to land his prey.
“It’s a big fellow!” said Walter in his excitement
as the contest continued. “It’ll weigh six pounds!
It pulls like a load of bricks! I didn’t know
there was a pickerel as big as that in Six Town
Pond!”</p>

<p>“Be careful,” said Dan in a low voice. “Let
him run! Give him line or you’ll tear the hook out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of his mouth! Not that way!” he added, as Walter
permitted the struggling fish to make swiftly for the
near-by weeds. “If you let him get among those
weeds he won’t stop to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>As Walter once more began to reel rapidly an
expression of consternation swept over his face
as he said, “It’s gone! There isn’t a bit of weight
on the line! It must have got away.”</p>

<p>“Reel in,” commanded Dan.</p>

<p>“I am reeling, but——” Walter stopped abruptly
as a savage pull upon his line interrupted his declaration.</p>

<p>The contest continued several minutes, neither of
the boys speaking. Walter’s excitement was intense,
and he stood up in the skiff to enable him to
look for the struggling pickerel.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” ordered Dan a trifle sharply.</p>

<p>“I can see better when I’m standing,” replied
Walter. “There it is!” he shouted as his victim
came within sight. “It’s a beauty! It’ll weigh
more than six pounds! It’s the biggest pickerel
I——”</p>

<p>“Look out! Don’t let him touch the boat!”
broke in Dan, as the huge pickerel made a sudden
rush beneath the skiff. “There! You’ve lost it!”
he added grimly, as the fish tore itself free from
the hook and with a swift turn darted beyond the
vision of the excited Walter.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” muttered Walter, as in deep
chagrin he resumed his seat. “I don’t see how it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
got away. You couldn’t have hooked it very well
in the first place, Dan.”</p>

<p>The young oarsman smiled a trifle derisively
as he said: “A good fisherman doesn’t have to have
a fish strapped and tied to land it. I told you not
to stand up.”</p>

<p>“What difference does standing make?”</p>

<p>“You have to balance yourself as well as handle
the rod. Only an expert can do that. Let me have
your line. Your bait is gone.”</p>

<p>As Dan drew in the line and again baited the
hook Walter laughed as he said: “Oh, well, Dan,
I’ll soon get the trick of it again. You must
remember that we don’t fish very much in the
streets of New York.”</p>

<p>“So I hear,” quietly responded Dan as he handed
back the fishing-rod.</p>

<p>“This time I’ll be careful, Dan,” continued Walter,
as he resumed his seat and let out his line again,
while his oarsman sent the skiff more swiftly ahead.</p>

<p>“You’ll get it next time.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so. Dan, how is the Rodman nine
this summer?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair. We have a game to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Who is to be the victim?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later about that.”</p>

<p>“What nine do you play?”</p>

<p>“The nine from Benson.”</p>

<p>“Same team you played last summer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>“Let me see; the score last year was thirty-seven
to nineteen, wasn’t it?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’ll it be this year?”</p>

<p>“I’m no prophet.”</p>

<p>“Seventy-four to thirty-eight?”</p>

<p>Dan smiled good-naturedly as he replied: “We’ll
have an umpire this year that can tell the difference
between a foul ball and a bunt. There’s a fellow
staying at the Wright place that knows baseball
like a book.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Moulton.”</p>

<p>“What Moulton?” asked Walter, interested at
once.</p>

<p>“He’s pitcher on one of the college nines.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Moulton from Princeton, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How long has he been here?”</p>

<p>“About three weeks.”</p>

<p>“Great! He’s one of the finest! He struck
out sixteen men in his first game this year?”</p>

<p>“Did he?”</p>

<p>“He did that,” said Walter, his interest becoming
still more manifest. “He’s one of the greatest
college players ever known. The New Yorks offered
him four thousand dollars a year to join
their team.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s going to umpire the game for us
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“Good! Great! He’ll be pretty sharp with you.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Who’s to pitch for your nine?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Who is to catch?”</p>

<p>“Tom.”</p>

<p>“Your brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think you’d have time to practise.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have much time.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been pitching?”</p>

<p>“Three weeks.”</p>

<p>“You played first base last year.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What made you think you could pitch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can. I’ll tell you more
about it to-morrow, after the game with Benson.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity I didn’t come up a little sooner. I
might have given you a little coaching. Of course,
I’m not a pitcher. I play short on the Tait School
nine. But I know a little how it ought to be done,
even if I can’t do it myself.”</p>

<p>“We have had a little coaching,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Who has been coaching you?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“Moulton.”</p>

<p>“What? The Princeton pitcher?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s great!” exclaimed Walter, his enthusiasm
returning in full measure. “How does he do
it? When do you get the time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“He comes over to the house every night after
supper.”</p>

<p>“And Moulton has been showing you how to
do it?”</p>

<p>“He has been trying. He has done his best. If
I don’t learn the fault isn’t his, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t miss that game to-morrow for a
fortune. I’m going to see how much you can do.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to play short?”</p>

<p>“I’m your man!”</p>

<p>“I thought you’d want to, so I saved the position
for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you! I’ll try not to disgrace—hold
on, I’ve got another strike! I don’t want
to lose this fellow!”</p>

<p>Once more Dan swung the skiff around until it
was broadside to the struggling fish. He was too
wise to make any suggestions to his companion at
such a time, though he quizzically watched his friend
as the latter attempted to follow the directions that
had been given him before. The pickerel was
securely hooked and at last Walter managed to bring
his victim near enough to the boat to enable Dan
to secure it with the aid of a landing-net.</p>

<p>“It’s only a little fellow!” exclaimed Walter in
disgust, as he looked at the fish after it had been
thrown upon the bottom of the boat. “It won’t
weigh more than a pound and a half. Not much
like the big one that got away.”</p>

<p>“That’s a trick fish have,” remarked Dan dryly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
as he once more resumed his task at the oars, after
he had placed a fresh bait on the hook.</p>

<p>“But the one I lost was a big one!” persisted
Walter.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m telling you. It will get bigger
and bigger all the time. To-night when you go
back to your grandfather’s, that pickerel will weigh
ten pounds at the very least. The weight increases
as the square of the distance.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Dan,” laughed Walter. “Have
it your own way. You’ll have to own up that I
landed this fellow all right, anyway.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t get away, it was hooked so well.
You could have landed it with a block and tackle.
It had swallowed the hook.”</p>

<p>“Well, you just watch me next time.”</p>

<p>An hour elapsed, however, without another strike.
The summer sun had climbed high into the heaven
and the waters of Six Town Pond were almost
like glass. Walter’s impatience increased as the
time slowly passed. Even conversation ceased and
at last Dan said:</p>

<p>“The water is almost too clear this morning,
Walter. I’m afraid we sha’n’t get many pickerel
to-day. It’s half past eleven,” he added as he
glanced at his watch. “Don’t you think we’d better
row over to the bluff and get a few perch for
dinner?”</p>

<p>“I’m ready,” responded Walter promptly. “Shall
I reel in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>“No; you might as well troll while we’re crossing
the pond. One never can tell, you know. By
the way, Walter, is this a pond or a lake?”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference? I always thought a
pond was a small lake.”</p>

<p>“A lake has an outlet; a pond doesn’t. No,
it’s the other way.”</p>

<p>“Then Ontario and Erie ought really to be called
Ontario Pond and Erie Pond—they both have outlets.”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” replied Dan, as he rowed under
the shadows of the high shore. “Now you’ll have
to show that you are a fisherman, Walter, or we
sha’n’t have any fish for dinner. Here, let me
change your tackle,” he added. In a brief time
the change was made, and as Walter dropped his
line into the water, Dan said: “I’ll take this other
pole and try my luck. When we get a half-dozen
perch that will be enough and we’ll go ashore.
There’s a stone fireplace up there among those
cedars which we can use.”</p>

<p>“There was one last summer. Is this the same
one?”</p>

<p>“I guess so; it hasn’t been disturbed. Now we’ll
see which will get the first perch,” he added, as he
dropped a line into the water on the opposite side
of the boat.</p>

<p>The question was speedily settled, for in a brief
time Dan landed two perch in quick succession.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you do it!” exclaimed Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“Then I’m afraid I can’t tell you,” said Dan
good-naturedly, making his perch captive in the
end of the boat.</p>

<p>“It’s just born in some people—hello! There!
I’ve got a bite!” Walter’s attention was quickly
centered upon the fish he had hooked and a few
minutes later, after he had succeeded in landing his
prey, he exclaimed: “Mine is the biggest one yet!
You can count yours if you want to. I’ll just
weigh mine.”</p>

<p>“All right. You might weigh this fellow too
while you are in the business,” said Dan quietly, as
he secured a perch much larger than his companion’s.
“Two more will give us all we want.”</p>

<p>The two additional perch were speedily secured,
Dan catching both of them, and then the skiff was
sent ashore and the boys leaped out and drew the
little boat far up on the sandy beach.</p>

<small>GREAT SNAKES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“You get some wood, Walter, and start a fire
in the fireplace, while I am cleaning the fish
and getting everything ready for dinner,” said Dan,
as the two boys, with the fish they had caught and
the cooking utensils in their hands, started toward
the grove on the bluff.</p>

<p>“Where’ll I find an axe?”</p>

<p>“There’s one in the skiff, but I don’t believe
you’ll need it. Just pick up some of the dead wood;
that’s all we want.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a roaring fire before you’re ready,”
laughed Walter, as he turned among the trees.
In a brief time he had collected sufficient wood, and
a blazing fire was soon made in the rude fireplace.
As he completed his task, Walter turned to his
companion, who now was peeling some potatoes.</p>

<p>“Put the kettle on and fill it with water from the
spring,” Dan said. “If you are as hungry as I am,
you won’t want to lose much time. I’ll have these
potatoes boiling before you know it, if you are
lively.”</p>

<p>“I’m your man,” laughed Walter, as he seized
the kettle and at once went to the bubbling little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
spring on the border of the woods. As soon as he
returned he placed the kettle over the fire, resting
it upon the flat stones. In a moment Dan dropped
his potatoes into the water and then turned to his
fish.</p>

<p>“They’re great, Dan!” exclaimed Walter, as he
saw his companion take the white-meated fish
which had been cleaned and skinned and, after he
had carefully placed them on the broiler, hold them
over the blazing fire. “Strange, isn’t it?” continued
Walter. “Less than an hour ago those
perch were swimming around in Six Town Pond
as lively as crickets. Three hours afterward they
are an important part of you and me. If I get
a home run in the game to-morrow, probably that
big perch that took my hook a few minutes ago will
be what provided the force. One minute, a live
fish chasing another smaller fish and trying to swallow
it, and the next just changed into the force
and nerve and muscle that knocks out a clean home
run. Ever think about that, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I have. You’d do better to drop
poetry and set the table.”</p>

<p>“You never get your feet off the earth, do you,
Dan?” laughed Walter, as he turned to do as he
was bidden.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen a live man yet that could do
that or lift himself by the straps of the boots he was
wearing. Hurry up with that table!”</p>

<p>Walter took the table, which had been folded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and stored in the skiff, and placed it in the shade of
a great tree near the fireplace. Two small camp-chairs
were next taken from the boat and then the
basket, in which a small tablecloth, some napkins,
and some knives and forks had been arranged, was
brought, and its contents spread upon the little table.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Walter!” called Dan laughingly, as
he faced his friend. “Dinner is almost ready. I
get a cloud of smoke in my eyes every little while
when the wind veers. That drives me away from
the fire, so I lose time. You might get that basket
under the stern seat—no, I left it in the buggy. It’s
the one that has the boiled eggs, the bread, pie,
cake, and etceteras in it. Bring it on if you want
to rush things a bit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have it here in a minute!” called Walter, as
he ran swiftly toward the shaded place where the
buggy had been left. Near the buggy was old
Prince, the horse which the boys had driven that
morning. Walter could see the black flanks of
the old horse among the trees and as he came
nearer he was startled when Prince suddenly snorted
as if he were in great fear and began to pull upon
the strap as if he were doing his utmost to get away.</p>

<p>“Whoa, old fellow!” called Walter. “What’s
the trouble now? The flies biting you? Great——”
he began as he came nearer the snorting animal and
then abruptly stopped at the startling sight he saw.
Crawling lazily over the grass toward the pond,
which was only a few yards distant, Walter beheld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
a snake larger than any he had ever seen out of
captivity. As he stopped the great snake also
stopped, and lifting its head gazed at the intruder,
darting its forked tongue as if it were minded to
drive its enemy from the place.</p>

<p>“Hi, Dan! Come over here! Come as fast as
you can run! Bring the axe!” called Walter in his
excitement. “Come on! Come on!”</p>

<p>Alarmed by the sharp call, Dan instantly dropped
the cooking utensils in his hands and seizing the
axe ran swiftly toward the spot where his friend
was standing. Not a word did he speak until he
stood by Walter’s side and then in a whisper he
asked, “What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“The biggest snake you ever saw has just
crawled into the weeds down there on the shore!”
said Walter excitedly, pointing as he spoke to
the huge bed of reeds near the water. “It was as
big around as an oar! It wasn’t a foot less than
seven feet long! Old Prince was scared out of
his——”</p>

<p>Dan waited to hear no more, but grasping his
axe, he ran swiftly toward the rushes where Walter
had said the great reptile had crawled.</p>

<p>“Come back here, Dan!” called Walter, shouting
to his friend. “You’ll get bitten or squeezed!
That thing is a terror! Come back here!”</p>

<p>But Dan did not heed the call of his excited companion.
Parting the tall rushes, he stepped boldly
into the midst of them and soon was concealed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Walter’s sight. Hesitating a moment, the latter
looked about him for a weapon of some kind, and
as none could be seen he hastily seized the whip in
the buggy and then ran swiftly to the aid of his
friend, whose danger he was convinced was great.
Cautiously approaching the rushes, he called,
“Where are you, Dan? I’m here to help! Where
are you?”</p>

<p>No reply came from the marsh, though Walter
was convinced that he could trace his friend’s way
by the movements of the tall rushes. Waiting a
moment anxiously, he called again: “Where are you,
Dan? Don’t take any chances! Come back here
and let the snake do as he pleases! Come on, Dan!
Come on!”</p>

<p>“Go back and look after the dinner!” came
a low call from the midst of the weeds.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to leave you here alone!” retorted
Walter.</p>

<p>“If you want anything to eat go back and look
after the fire. I don’t want any help.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen anything of the snake?”</p>

<p>No reply was made to the query and after delaying
a brief time Walter walked slowly back to the
place where the fire was burning. He repeatedly
assured himself that he was not “nervous,” but
several times he was startled and stopped abruptly
until he was able to decide whether a long dead
branch in his pathway was really what it appeared
to be. However, without any serious mishap he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
arrived at the place he was seeking and instantly
discovered that Dan’s warning was most timely, for
the fire had burned low and the frying-pan had
tipped so that one of the perch had fallen into the
ashes. Quickly righting the pan, he at once placed
fresh wood upon the fire and soon had everything
restored to its proper place. As he turned to look
toward the marsh he saw his friend approaching,
and it was manifest that he had not secured the
snake.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Dan? Where’s the snake?”
inquired Walter.</p>

<p>“Got away,” answered his friend.</p>

<p>“Did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How big is it?”</p>

<p>“Long as a fence rail.”</p>

<p>“I told you it was. Did you ever see as big a one
before?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Did it turn on you?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was going to, but it probably
thought better of it, for it made for the deep water
and I lost sight of it.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a snake was it?”</p>

<p>“Just a plain water-snake, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want it to bite me. I don’t like
snakes anyway. The sight of one makes my flesh
creep.”</p>

<p>“That’s all foolishness. A snake is a mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
pretty thing. I’ve taken little striped snakes up in
my hands a good many times and examined them.
Their marking is great, Walter!”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to take your word for it!”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to, for you can see for yourself.
This big fellow might put up a good fight
if he was cornered, but I don’t believe he would
touch anyone if he was left alone.”</p>

<p>“He scared old Prince all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, he was something of a snake, but he
wouldn’t touch a live animal unless it was a frog
or a squirrel.”</p>

<p>“Eats dead fish, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you don’t eat live ones, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it. There, I’m glad he’s gone.
Think there are any more like him around here?”</p>

<p>“Some snakes go in pairs.”</p>

<p>“Do they?” inquired Walter, glancing anxiously
about him as he spoke, an action that brought a
trace of a smile to Dan’s face. “I’m not afraid,”
said Walter hastily, as he noticed the expression
on his friend’s face. “I just don’t like their company,
that’s all. Are there many around here?”</p>

<p>“I guess if you should walk up the beach to
those flat rocks yonder you’d find plenty of them.”</p>

<p>“Any here?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Most too cool here. Snakes like
warm spots.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the fire will draw them, then.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not ‘afraid,’ I tell you. I just don’t like
the crawling things!”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. We’ll set the table now. I
guess everything is ready.”</p>

<p>Quickly the two boys placed their dinner on the
little table. The smoking potatoes, the fish browned
and hot, the various tempting viands which Grandmother
Sprague had provided made a great display,
and for a time conversation ceased, as both boys did
full justice to the repast. Overhead the spreading
branches of the huge chestnut trees provided ample
shade. Before them were the waters of the pond
shining and shimmering under the rays of the
noontide heat. On the opposite shore men busy in
the fields could be seen and over all was the glory
of the perfect summer day.</p>

<p>“This is the way to live, Dan!” said Walter at
last. “Why don’t more people try it?”</p>

<p>“Probably they are too busy trying to get an
income.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. My father says it’s a great
thing for a man to learn to live within his income.
He’s trying to teach me how to keep inside of my
allowance.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so,” said Dan a little dryly,
“but to me it has always seemed as if there was
something better than that.”</p>

<p>“Better than living inside of one’s income?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Learning how to live without an income.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” laughed Walter. “I
suppose it’s true.”</p>

<p>“It is, when you are wanting to do what I’m going
to try.”</p>

<p>“You mean working your way through school
and college?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I mean.”</p>

<p>“A good many have done it,” suggested Walter
lightly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear that is so, but I’ve heard too that
a great many people die every year. I don’t know
that that fact makes dying any easier for the
man when his own time comes.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Dan? Did the big snake
scare you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What is it then?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of that home run you’re going
to make to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“We’ll need it.”</p>

<p>“Have they a good nine?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you more about that after the game.”</p>

<p>“You’re the king-pin, Dan. If you have a good
head on your shoulders——”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ve noticed that it’s the man with a head
that gets ahead.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do,” laughed Walter, leaping to his feet
as he spoke. “What’s next?”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“The ‘next thing’ is to wash these dishes and
put them back in the baskets where they
belong.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” drawled Walter lazily.</p>

<p>“Some day we’ll want to use them again.”</p>

<p>“Use them, then; I don’t object.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll want them clean.”</p>

<p>“They were clean enough just now, weren’t they?
You put some potato on the plate on which I’d
been eating potato and fish, didn’t you? I didn’t
find any fault, did I?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice any very vociferous complaint.”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t. Well, if a plate is clean
enough to keep on eating from, I don’t see any
use in bothering with it.”</p>

<p>“You mean that dishes that are clean enough
to stop eating on are clean enough to begin with
again?” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“You’ve struck the nail on the head the first
time.”</p>

<p>“That may do in New York. It won’t do here.”</p>

<p>“It’s just a fad, that’s all,” asserted Walter.
“It’s a fashion and nothing more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“You can explain it to your Grandmother
Sprague when we go home, but I don’t care to be
there when she expresses her opinion, that is, if I
happen to be the one who has not done his work
as he ought to.”</p>

<p>“She has some rather strong ideas on that subject,”
admitted Walter demurely. “I’m afraid she’s
a little prejudiced. She has the boards on the
kitchen floor scoured with soap and water and sand
till they fairly glisten. I said to her the other
day: ‘Grandmother, don’t you really think there are
some things in life that are more important than
just keeping clean a few old pine boards in the floor
of your kitchen?’”</p>

<p>“What did she say?” inquired Dan, smiling as
he spoke. “Your grandmother has the reputation
of being one of the best housekeepers in the county.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say much; but, somehow, I didn’t
stay long to show her how mistaken she was. She
just emptied a bucket of water on the floor where
I was standing and I fled.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t make any mistake in that. Now
then, I’ll have to wash these dishes, and it’s time I
began,” said Dan, as he leaped to his feet and prepared
for his task.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if you are set upon it, I suppose I’ll
have to help; but honestly, Dan, I don’t see any
reason in it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to help. You pay me for my
time, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right. I’m going to do my share.”</p>

<p>“Come on then, if you mean it.”</p>

<p>The dishes speedily were carried to the spring
and as both boys worked rapidly the disagreeable
duty was quickly completed.</p>

<p>“There! Now if you feel better we can try the
fishing again,” said Walter, as he and his friend
returned to the shaded place where the table had
been set.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t much use in trolling
now,” said Dan, as he looked over the still and
shining waters of the pond.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s too warm and still. The pickerel make for
the cooler places when the sun is as warm as it is
now.”</p>

<p>“Then we can go to those ‘cooler places’ if that
is where the fish go, can’t we? A fellow ought to
use his head when he’s fishing, just the same as he
does when he’s playing ball.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t his head—it’s his oars,” explained Dan.
“We simply can’t get into the places where the
pickerel hide. Besides, they won’t bite much till
the water is cooler.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand that any more than I can
about the dishes we just washed. A pickerel is
always hungry, isn’t he? Well, if he is always
hungry, then he’ll eat always, won’t he?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to go to him to get your
information.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to do.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll try the trolling again if you
like.”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon,” replied Walter, whose desire for
an argument was keener than his wish to be out
on the water under the burning sun. “Just now I’m
interested in that flicker. What does he make all
that noise for?”</p>

<p>“He’s after the worms in that dead tree where
he’s hammering.”</p>

<p>“A bird is a cruel animal.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’ll smash and hammer a poor little worm
or a bug he catches till there isn’t a spark of life
left. Oh, I don’t believe in harming the birds,”
Walter hastily added as he saw a look of surprise
on Dan’s face. “It isn’t that. Only when I hear
so much about saving the birds, I can’t help thinking
of the poor little grubs and bugs his birdship doesn’t
have any mercy for. See? Why don’t we try to
save the bugs and worms as well as the birds?”</p>

<p>“If you lived on a farm you’d know the reason
why.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“They kill the crops.”</p>

<p>“So we kill them because they affect our pockets.
Is that it?”</p>

<p>“I guess it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“Then it isn’t wrong to kill things that take what
we want. It’s only wrong to kill what doesn’t interfere
with our plans.”</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” said Dan, somewhat
puzzled by his friend’s apparent seriousness. “My
conscience doesn’t trouble me when I kill the grasshoppers
and——”</p>

<p>“And yet the grasshopper is a wonderful creature.
He makes his music with his hind legs.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” sniffed Dan scornfully.</p>

<p>“Everybody knows it—unless he lives in the
country.”</p>

<p>“I guess that is the kind of talk you hear on
Broadway.”</p>

<p>“It’s true, no matter where you hear it.”</p>

<p>“You say it is; that’s why you think it’s so.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I say it because it is true, Dan. What
does a squirrel do in the winter? Does he go to
sleep the way the bears do, or does he——”</p>

<p>“I guess he does,” broke in Dan. “You can ask
more questions than a four-year-old boy.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t answer me. If I lived all the
year where you do I’d find out some of these
things.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. It’s a good way.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is.”</p>

<p>“Who printed the first newspaper in New
York?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I do. It was William Bradford. He established<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
the first printing-press in New York in 1693.
There’s a tablet to his memory at the Cotton
Exchange. Who was the mayor of New York
when the present City Hall was built?”</p>

<p>“I give it up. Can you tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. DeWitt Clinton. Where can one
find statues of Franklin and Greeley in New York
City?”</p>

<p>“I know that—Printing House Square,” laughed
Walter.</p>

<p>“Good. What is Franklin holding in his hand?”</p>

<p>“I give it up. What is it?”</p>

<p>“A copy of his first newspaper—‘The Pennsylvanian.’
Where is the Peter Cooper pear tree?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out on the pond and try the pickerel.”</p>

<p>“All right; only the next time you suggest that
I ought to know all about the habits of the squirrels
and the bugs, I’m going to ask you about Minetta
Creek——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“That is the name of the little creek in Greenwich
village——”</p>

<p>“You know a lot, Dan. I guess you’ve got
me all right. I won’t say anything more about a
fellow finding out what is going on where he lives
until I learn a little more about my own town.
Where did you find all this out—I mean the things
you’re telling me?”</p>

<p>“I read about them, same as you read about
grasshoppers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Come on,” said Walter, rising as he spoke.
“Look out for snakes, Dan.”</p>

<p>The great snake was not seen as the two boys
once more sought their boat and in a brief time
resumed their trolling. Three hours passed and
Walter seldom had a strike. “You’re right, Dan,”
he said at last; “there isn’t a hungry pickerel in the
pond.”</p>

<p>“Too hot,” remarked Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that’s what you said. Perhaps we’d
better quit. We’ve a good seven miles to go—back
to my grandfather’s.”</p>

<p>“This is the best time in the day for fishing.”</p>

<p>“You have your milking to do. I don’t want
to keep you from that.”</p>

<p>“My brother will look after the chores to-night.
You’ve paid for this day and it belongs to you if
you want it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Walter. “You row along
the edge of those weeds yonder and by the time we
get back to the place where Prince is I’m sure I’ll
have had enough.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” said Dan, as he rowed the
skiff toward the long stretch of weeds to which his
companion had pointed. “Now look sharp,” he
added as they drew near the reeds. “You’ve got
the right time and you’ve got your pickerel!” he
added sharply as there came a savage tug on Walter’s
line. “It’s a beauty!” he shouted as a huge
fish leaped from the water a hundred feet in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
rear of the boat. “Give him your line! Let him
have the bait! Don’t yank it out of his mouth!”</p>

<p>Walter did not respond as he did his utmost to
follow his friend’s instructions. “Now!” shouted
Dan, “give him a quick, sharp, hard yank! That’s
right. You’ve hooked him! Now look out that
he doesn’t get any slack! Reel in slowly! If he
tries to run let him have line, only don’t take your
thumb off the reel!”</p>

<p>The tip of Walter’s rod was suddenly drawn
under the water and the boy in his excitement
started to rise from his seat. “Sit down!” ordered
Dan. “Don’t let him drag your rod under, whatever
you do! That’s no way to fish! Keep a good
tight line and your rod out of the water!”</p>

<p>“Who’s doing this?” inquired Walter testily.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to have you do it,” retorted Dan.</p>

<p>“Well, let me do it then! I’m going to save
or lose this pickerel all by myself! You look after
your oars——”</p>

<p>“Good!” broke in Dan good-naturedly. “Now
you’re talking like a fisherman. I’ll keep the skiff
broadside on and you can do the rest.”</p>

<p>Silence followed and the contest continued. Excited
as Walter was, he nevertheless was mindful
of his every act. Again and again he reeled the
huge fish near the boat, only to have the pickerel,
which was fighting for its life, dart swiftly away.
The reel “sang,” but Walter, mindful now of the
care and skill required, did not for a moment relax<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
his vigilance. Steadily and cautiously he reeled
his victim back toward the boat, until at last the
huge pickerel was plainly to be seen.</p>

<p>“It’s a monster!” exclaimed Walter excitedly,
as he obtained his first view of the great fish. “It’s
the biggest pickerel I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Tire him out,” said Dan quietly. “It’s your
only chance.”</p>

<p>Once more the fish, as it saw the occupants of the
skiff, darted swiftly away, but Walter was wiser
now, as well as more careful, and giving his victim
a free line he did not begin to reel again until the
pull ceased upon his line. His excitement redoubled,
but Dan smiled approvingly as he marked his
friend’s caution. Three times more the desperate
pickerel darted away, but the run was shorter each
time and there was less resistance each successive
time that the young fisherman reeled in his victim.</p>

<p>“Bring him alongside now,” directed Dan. “Be
careful! If he touches the boat with his tail he’ll
get a purchase and break away. There! That’s
right! I’ll have to use a gaff on him, the net is too
small. Good! That’s exactly where I want him!”</p>

<p>Taking his gaff, Dan suddenly thrust it under
the pickerel and then with one quick, strong pull
brought the great fish into the skiff. Despite the
floppings and flounderings of the safely landed fish,
Dan gave it one hard blow with a short hickory
club and its struggles were ended.</p>

<p>“That’s what I always do,” he explained. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
don’t want to keep a fish in misery; and, besides, it’s
better eating if killed quickly.”</p>

<p>“Dan! Dan! Look there!” abruptly exclaimed
Walter in a low voice, and as his companion looked
up, instantly he saw what had aroused the attention
of his companion. Not more than five yards away,
and swimming near the border of the rushes, was
the huge snake which Walter had seen a few
hours previous to this time.</p>

<small>PREPARATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Get it, Dan!” shouted Walter. “Use your
oar! Hit it!”</p>

<p>The young oarsman obediently swung the skiff
about and started swiftly in pursuit of the reptile,
but before the weeds were gained the snake disappeared
and a further search failed to reveal its
presence.</p>

<p>“Too bad, Walter,” said Dan lightly. “What
did you want of it?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d have the skin tanned or stuffed and
hang it on the wall of my room in school.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“‘What for?’ For an ornament.”</p>

<p>“Do the boys in the Tait School think snakes
are ornamental?”</p>

<p>“Well, it would be interesting anyway. But it’s
gone now and there’s no use in talking about it any
more. You weren’t quick enough, Dan.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t quick enough, that’s a fact. A
fellow would have to be about as lively as a flash of
lightning to catch one of those fellows on the water.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see as big a one as that was?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“Sure it was a water-snake, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve seen the time early in the month
when a fellow walking along the shore of Six Town
Pond would stir up hundreds of these fellows—little
chaps a good many of them. The last time
I was here—and that is more than a year ago—I
saw a lively fight between a water-snake and a
brown thrush.”</p>

<p>“Which won? What were they fighting about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, though I suspect that the snake
had been robbing the thrush’s nest. Probably had
stolen the eggs or had swallowed the young ones.
The old bird was screaming and flying at the snake’s
eyes and head, while his snakeship was doing his
best to get back to the water. He’d crawl a few
feet as lively as he could go and then he’d have
to stop and defend himself when the thrush would
get in some fine work. It was a lively tilt, let me
tell you.”</p>

<p>“Did the snake get away?”</p>

<p>“Yes; though I’m sure he had a headache.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come back and get this fellow!” said
Walter eagerly. “Why can’t we come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Because we’re both to play ball.”</p>

<p>“So we are,” laughed Walter. “That’s the
first time I ever forgot about a ball game, but I
certainly would like to have that skin. Dan, shall
we try for any more pickerel?”</p>

<p>“That’s for you to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>Walter hesitated a moment before he said: “I’m
sure I could get some more. It’s just the right time
of day, and now that I’ve learned just how to
land the big fellows—— You needn’t laugh,” he
broke in abruptly as a trace of a smile appeared on
Dan’s face. “Didn’t I play this last pickerel I
caught all right? It didn’t get away anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No, it didn’t because it couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why did you keep telling me not to give it
any slack then? If there wasn’t any danger of
losing it what difference did it make what I did?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see then how well it was hooked.”</p>

<p>“It was hooked all right.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was. A yoke of oxen might have
hauled it ashore and there wouldn’t have been a
chance for the pickerel.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a beauty anyway,” said Walter proudly
as he glanced down at the great fish on the bottom
of the skiff. “What will it weigh, Dan?”</p>

<p>“It ‘will’ weigh nine or ten pounds and get
heavier every time you tell how you caught it,”
replied Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“No. Tell me honestly what you think it weighs
now.”</p>

<p>“It may tip the scales at eight pounds.”</p>

<p>“More than that!” asserted Walter confidently.
“Dan, I’d like to stay and get two or three more
like this fellow, but I guess we’d better start for
home. It’ll be dark before we get there, even if
we start right away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” assented Dan promptly, as he instantly
began to row toward the landing-place.</p>

<p>“We’ll come back for the snake and some more
of those big pickerel some other time.”</p>

<p>“They’ll keep,” said Dan shortly.</p>

<p>Old Prince, with a whinny, greeted the return of
the boys. In a brief time the skiff was placed in
the little boat-house on the shore, the rods and
various belongings were put into the buggy, and last
of all the big pickerel was wrapped in a bag and
covered with a cloth under the seat.</p>

<p>“Some people count the fish they catch; others
weigh them,” said Walter with a laugh as the
homeward journey was begun.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess that’s so,” assented Dan. “Sometimes
there seems to be a great deal of difficulty
with the scales though.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be this time. Eight pounds, Dan.
Don’t forget that. Be sure you don’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to forget it—when you are anywhere
near.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll take all the responsibility.
Tell me about the game to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you better after to-morrow. I can’t
weigh fish before I have anything to weigh them
with and I can’t tell you about a game before it’s
played.”</p>

<p>“You’re a great chap, Dan!” laughed Walter.
“I’m afraid you haven’t any imagination.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the ability to see things—a little different
from what they really are.”</p>

<p>“I see. I guess old Si Slater, the harness-maker,
must have more imagination, as you call it, than any
other man in——”</p>

<p>“Why, what makes you think he has?”</p>

<p>“He never has been known to tell anything as it
is. He sees things a little different from what they
really are. You say that’s ‘imagination.’ Perhaps
it is, but we poor chaps up here in the country don’t
call it by that name exactly.”</p>

<p>“What do you call it?” inquired Walter laughingly.</p>

<p>“We just say Si Slater is the biggest liar in seven
counties.”</p>

<p>“Is Si as fat as ever? I haven’t seen him since
I came.”</p>

<p>“Fatter. You’ll see him to-morrow—and hear
him too.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What I say.”</p>

<p>“Is Si a ‘rooter’?”</p>

<p>“I guess so, though I’m sure I don’t know what
a ‘rooter’ is.”</p>

<p>“Why, a ‘rooter’ is a wild ‘fan.’”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said Dan dryly. “While
you are about it you might explain what a ‘wild
fan’ is.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say a ‘wild fan.’ I said a ‘fan’ that
is wild. A fan is a baseball enthusiast—one that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
takes in all the games. A ‘rooter’ is one that yells
for his team——”</p>

<p>“I see. I guess you can rely on Si’s yelling all
right, and on his attendance too. You’ll know it if
he is there.”</p>

<p>“Know anything about the other nine, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except that they haven’t lost a game
this summer.”</p>

<p>“How many have they played?”</p>

<p>“Five.”</p>

<p>“You going to pitch?”</p>

<p>“At the start. If they drive me out of the box
we’ll have to call on you or someone else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep. I regularly play short, but I can
pitch a little. If I could only curve a baseball the
way I can a tennis ball I’d fool the batter every
time. What does Moulton say about your work?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say much.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I understand he’s a quiet fellow anyway.”</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p>“Has he found much fault with your work?”</p>

<p>“No. He doesn’t say much about it, as I told
you.”</p>

<p>“Probably he thinks you are doing all right or
he would say so,” said Walter, a little condescending
in his manner. “You go ahead and try it to-morrow
and if you fall down I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p>It was late when the boys arrived at the place
they were seeking and their coming was announced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
by Walter’s shouts. When his grandfather came
out of the house to greet the young fishermen the
huge pickerel was displayed and the quiet comments
of his grandfather were highly pleasing to
the elated Walter. As he turned to say good night
to his companion he again referred to the game of
the morrow. “Don’t you be anxious, Dan. You
start in with your pitching and just remember that
if the Benson nine finds your curves you can rely
on me to help you out.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Walter,” replied Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“The game is at three?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be over on time.”</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Dan,” responded Walter as he
entered the house.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Long before the time of the game on the following
day Walter was on the field. Dressed in the
uniform of his school nine, he was aware of the
contrast between his neat, well-fitting suit and the
quaint uniforms of the players who were on the
ground. A smile of satisfaction and a slight deepening
of his condescending manner were perhaps not
unnatural in view of the appearance of the two
nines. On each there were two or three who
had no uniforms at all.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to play with our nine?”</p>

<p>Walter turned as the question was asked, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
found himself face to face with Si Slater, the village
harness-maker. Si’s round face was glowing
with interest and his fat body was perspiring in
spite of his continued fanning with his straw hat of
broad brim.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought I would help the fellows out,”
replied Walter, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“All right. Ye’ll have t’ go some t’ keep up with
Dan an’ Tom Richards. They’re the best ball
players in the whole county.”</p>

<p>“Are they?”</p>

<p>“You’re right they be. I’ve seen Dan knock a
ball ’most forty rod.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll do it this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“He will if he gets half a chance. I guess maybe
you’ve played ball before, from th’ looks o’ those
clothes ye’re wearin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am on the school nine.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t say! Well, do your prettiest! We
don’t want them Benson chaps to go home crowin’
over us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try not to let them do that.”</p>

<p>“Hi! Look at that, will ye!” shouted the
harness-maker as he slapped his hands on his fat
thighs and pointed to a ball which Dan, who was
batting flies for his fielders, had sent far over the
heads of the scattered field. “I’ve wondered a
heap o’ times why the New Yorks didn’t send up
here for Dan. I guess he could give ’em all some
points on the game!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Have you ever seen the New Yorks play?”</p>

<p>“No; I can’t say ’t I have. I was talkin’ t’ Dan
a spell ago an’ I suggested that he should send
word for ’em t’ come up here and have a game.
I guess they’d open their eyes when they see Tom
and Dan.”</p>

<p>“What did Dan say?” inquired Walter quizzically.</p>

<p>“Nothin’. He isn’t much o’ a talker, Dan isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I shall be interested to-day in watching him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye watch him too much. Ye want t’ keep
both eyes on yer own job. Hi! Hi! Hi!” roared
the enthusiastic Si as Dan lifted another high fly.
“That’s a pretty one. That’s th’ ticket, Dan!”
The harness-maker doubled his noisy applause and
Walter turned to take his place as short-stop in the
preliminary practice. He smiled as he saw that the
diamond was laid out in an ordinary pasture. The
lines had not been cut in the turf, and even the
pitcher’s box was on the dry sward, indicated by
chalk marks. As he looked about him he saw that
the players were a brown and sturdy lot, but their
somewhat awkward attempts to stop the ball
brought once more a smile of condescension to his
face. He laughed as he recalled Si Slater’s suggestion
as to a game with the New Yorks, but in a
brief time he was busied in his own practice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When at last Walter and the Rodman nine
came in from the field in order that the
Benson players might have their share in the preliminary
practice he laughed as he looked at the
crowd that had assembled to watch the game. It
was not much like the well-dressed assemblage that
he knew was keenly watching every member of the
nine when the Tait School played its great rival
the Military Academy at Franklin. Automobiles
then were regularly arranged back of the outfielders,
the grandstand was gay with colors, and the cheers
and songs, led by appointed leaders, broke in sharply
on the tense silence that followed certain plays.
Here, however, it was a motley crowd. Small boys
were perched in the adjoining trees, awkward-appearing
vehicles were standing here and there
about the field, men with broad-brimmed straw hats
and some with their trousers tucked inside of the
tops of their high boots were eagerly watching the
members of the two nines. If Walter was amused
his feeling was not unkind, but the sight was so
different from any he had ever seen before that
perhaps his feeling was not unnatural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Moulton now stepped forward and summoned the
rival captains. As Dan turned away from the brief
interview he waved his hand as a signal for his
players to take the field, when Walter and the
other members of the Rodman nine ran to their
various positions in the field. The ball at last was
thrown to Dan, and as the umpire called “play
ball” the game was about to begin. Dan was very
deliberate as he took the ball, rolled it in the dust
a moment, then stepped into the pitcher’s box and
drew back his arm.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called Moulton, as the ball lodged in
Tom Richards’ hands.</p>

<p>“That’s the way, Dan!” called Walter from his
position of short-stop.</p>

<p>Ignoring the encouragement of his friend Dan
sent in a slow ball, at which the batter lunged
heavily, but failed to hit. A laugh arose from the
Rodman supporters at the ludicrous attempt of the
batter. Before the latter had fully recovered, Dan
sent a swift ball directly over the plate and Moulton
called the third strike.</p>

<p>“That fellow’s out!” Walter heard the harness-maker
shout gleefully.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Si!” responded another Rodman
supporter. “Better give that fellow a pine log
for a bat!”</p>

<p>“Barn door’d be better!” roared Silas. “They
can’t touch Dan!” Walter turned to look at Dan,
who now was facing the second member of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
opposing nine. The pitcher’s manner still was as
quiet as if he was unaware of the noisy approval of
his supporters. “Keep it up, Dan,” said Walter
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Swinging his long arms, Dan for an instant turned
his back to the batter, and then in a moment resuming
his position he sent the ball in with all his
strength. So sudden was his movement that the
Benson player was unable to dodge the ball and
was struck with its full force upon his left shoulder.
Howling with pain he clapped one hand upon
the wounded spot and began to dance excitedly
about the home plate. “Ou-u-ch!” he cried.
“Jiminy! that hurt!”</p>

<p>“Take your base!” ordered Moulton.</p>

<p>“Can’t ye give a feller a chance t’ git his breath?”
demanded the unfortunate batsman indignantly.</p>

<p>“Take your base,” said Moulton again in a low
voice.</p>

<p>Grumbling and still twisting and rubbing the
wounded shoulder the runner slowly made his way
to the first base.</p>

<p>“You’ve got them scared, Dan,” called Walter
encouragingly. “Keep it up!” Dan did not glance
at his friend as he once more faced the batter. Suddenly
whirling about he threw the ball with terrific
speed to the first-baseman, who touched the startled
Benson player before the latter was fully aware of
his peril.</p>

<p>“He’s out!” called Moulton sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>“He had his foot in the way! He kept me off
the base!” angrily shouted the runner.</p>

<p>The umpire did not even glance at the player as
the angry protest was heard. “Batter up!” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>“But I’m tellin’ ye I ain’t out,” again called the
disgruntled Benson player. “He had his foot——”</p>

<p>“You’re out!” interrupted Moulton quietly.
Then, ignoring the player, who at last with many
mutterings and shakings of his head slowly rejoined
his comrades, he was again watching the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” he called as Dan sent a slow ball
over the plate.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” he added a moment later.</p>

<p>“Strike two!” was his next announcement.</p>

<p>“Foul ball!” came the verdict, as the batter sent
the ball far back over the catcher’s head.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” Moulton quietly said as the next
ball came in swiftly.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t over the plate!” protested the Benson
player loudly, as he flung his bat in anger upon
the ground. The Rodman nine, however, were now
running in from the field, and as the umpire did
not pay the slightest attention to the protests of
the recent batsman he soon joined his fellows on
the field.</p>

<p>“Great work, Dan!” exclaimed Walter, as, after
selecting his bat, he stopped a moment beside his
friend and patted him on the shoulder. “You
struck out two men and caught another off first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry I hit him,” said Dan gently.</p>

<p>“It’s all in the game!” retorted Walter lightly.
“And now let’s see what we can do at the bat. I’m
the second man up and you follow me, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Better get your bat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have it when my turn comes.”</p>

<p>Tom Richards came first to bat and after hitting
two fouls he sent a slow ball toward third base,
which the fielder threw somewhat wildly and Tom
was safe at first, to the delight of Silas, who noisily
expressed his pleasure.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bunt, Dan,” said Walter in a low
voice. “I’ll sacrifice Tom to second or third if he
can steal second.”</p>

<p>“Give him a chance and he’ll steal it all right.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make a sacrifice hit.”</p>

<p>“Better line it out, Walter,” suggested Dan as his
friend advanced to the plate. Walter smiled, but
did not respond as he confidently faced the pitcher
of the opposing nine. He permitted the first ball
to pass and a strike was promptly called by Moulton.
Pretending to hit at the second ball his action
slightly confused the catcher who dropped the ball
as Tom sped safely to second. The next ball Walter
tapped lightly, and as it rolled slowly toward the
third-baseman the latter seized it and threw swiftly
to first, Tom meanwhile gaining third base safely on
the play.</p>

<p>“Is that th’ best ye can do?” demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
harness-maker as Walter turned away from first
base. “A baby could hit as far’s you did.”</p>

<p>“That was a bunt,” said Walter flushing slightly
as some of the spectators near Silas laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see ’twas—a baby-bunter.”</p>

<p>“I made a sacrifice hit to put Tom on third.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ye did, did ye? Well, I guess if Tom
couldn’t run like a white-head all yer buntin’
wouldn’t ’a’ helped him. Hi! That’s th’ way t’
do things!” Silas shouted as Dan hit a ball that
passed far over the head of the left-fielder. “That’s
th’ way t’ play ball! No city fellow could do that,
Dannie, my boy! Go it! Go on! Run, ye little
terror!” he added in his excitement as Dan turned
second and sped on toward the third base, Tom
meanwhile having leisurely crossed the home plate.</p>

<p>The noisy plaudits of the assembly redoubled
when the next player to face the Benson pitcher
drove a liner above the head of the second-baseman
and Dan ran home. There was, however, no
concerted cheering, everyone acting upon his own
impulse, while above the din steadily rose the stentorian
cries of Silas. “I told ye our boys could
play ball!” he roared. “We’ll beat ’em! We’ll
send ’em home with their tail-feathers all pulled
out! Hoein’ corn is th’ ticket for th’ Benson nine!
Who-o-o-p! Ho-e-e-e!” Walter smiled as he
watched the excited spectators, in his mind contrasting
the motley crowd with the well-organized
and united cheering and singing that rose from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
“bleachers” of the Tait School when the school
nine was battling on the diamond. The difference
was so marked that, full of the thought of the lack
of knowledge on the part of the assemblage, he
smiled in an added air of condescension. Then he
turned to one of the Rodman nine who was selecting
a bat, preparatory to following the player whose
turn to face the pitcher had been loudly proclaimed
by the scorer. “Take a good hold of your bat,”
suggested Walter. “Don’t take the end of the bat.
Put your hands a little farther up and don’t try
to ‘kill’ the ball. Just meet it with your bat.
There’s force enough in the ball to send it as far as
you want it to go if it just strikes the bat—that is,
if you keep a good grip.”</p>

<p>“Is that the reason why you made such a long
hit?” inquired the player as he left Walter and
stepped to the plate in place of the batter, who
had popped a little fly directly into the hands of the
pitcher.</p>

<p>“That was a ‘bunt’ I made,” said Walter tartly.</p>

<p>“Not much of a bunt at that,” laughed the player.</p>

<p>Half angry and yet amused, Walter watched the
batter as he swung back, and then as the ball sped
toward him, lunged forward and struck with all his
might.</p>

<p>“Strike,” called the umpire promptly.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s a strike,” said Walter as he seated
himself beside Dan on the grass. “Look at the
great awkward clouter,” he added as the batter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
again endeavored to strike with all his might.
“What’s the fellow thinking of? Is he trying to
drive it across the road yonder?”</p>

<p>“If Josh hits it once that’s about where it will
go,” replied Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he can’t hit it!” retorted Walter triumphantly
as the batter was called out on strikes
after he had made another terrific attempt to hit
the swiftly thrown ball. “That’s three out,” he
added as he and his companion arose. “Dan, if
you can keep up your good work those Benson
fellows will be a sorry looking lot when they start
for their native lair.”</p>

<p>Dan, however, did not respond. Taking his position
near the box, he began to throw the ball swiftly,
first to one baseman and then to another. In a
brief time the game was resumed and Dan’s labors
were renewed.</p>

<p>“Ball one,” called the umpire after the first ball
was delivered.</p>

<p>“Strike one” and “ball two” and “ball three”
followed in order, the batter apparently making no
attempt to hit.</p>

<p>“Look out thar, Dan’l!” shouted Silas. “Watch
that fellow; don’t ye let him fool ye!”</p>

<p>“Careful, Dan,” suggested Walter in a low voice.</p>

<p>The batter, however, awkwardly struck the ball
and a high foul resulted, the catcher succeeding,
after a long run, in reaching and holding it.</p>

<p>“Hi! That’s one out! Put that down in yer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
book or ye may forget it!” roared Silas to the
scorer. “I guess those Benson fellows feel a little
homesick! Don’t be too hard on ’em, Dan! Jes’
let ’em knock a ball t’ th’ city fellow ye’ve got for
short-stop.”</p>

<p>Walter’s cheeks flushed slightly as a laugh from
the crowd greeted the suggestion of Silas, but he
did not glance in the direction of the noisy harness-maker.</p>

<p>The next batter “fanned” and Silas gave vent to
his glee in renewed calls upon the Benson nine to
“shut up shop.” When the third man faced Dan
and he too “fanned” out, even Walter began to
share in the excitement that prevailed in the Rodman
contingent.</p>

<p>“Dan, you’ve struck out five of the six men that
have faced you,” he said warmly as he walked beside
his friend from the diamond.</p>

<p>“Luck, I guess,” said Dan dryly.</p>

<p>“Then it’s mighty good luck, that’s all I can
say,” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“The game is young yet,” Dan remarked quietly.</p>

<p>“So it is, but that doesn’t change the fact that
in the first two innings the Bensons haven’t got but
one man as far as first or that you have struck out
five of the six who have faced you.”</p>

<p>It was plain that Dan did not desire to talk and
Walter too was soon silent, watching the batters.
The first man up received his base on balls, the
second batter made a hit and in the throw-in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
runner gained third, while the batter, by a burst of
speed, succeeded in reaching second amid great applause.</p>

<p>“Get up, Dan. Tell them to try a double steal!”
suggested Walter eagerly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“They can work a squeeze play if they want to.”</p>

<p>“A double steal?”</p>

<p>“No; a squeeze play.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a——” Dan stopped abruptly as Silas
at that moment came toward the two boys.</p>

<small>A DISPUTE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Tell him to get off the field,” said Walter in
a low voice as he saw the stout harness-maker
approaching.</p>

<p>“Tell ye what, Dan,” roared Silas, “ye’re jest
givin’ Benson somethin’ t’ think on. Our boys are
jest knockin’ th’ cover right off th’ ball.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t look like it,” responded Dan
quietly as the Rodman batter hit a little fly to the
short-stop, who turned quickly and caught one of
the runners. It was the first occasion for a shout
from the followers of the Benson nine and the
applause was as noisy as it was prolonged. Two
boys, one with a pitchfork in his hand, jumped
down from their seat in a farm wagon which they
had driven to a place not far from third base.
“Hello, Si!” shouted one of the boys. “We’re
goin’ t’ give you fellows a dose you’ll never forget.”</p>

<p>“Be ye?” retorted Silas, his round face shining
under the heat and his excitement. “If ye keep
up as ye’ve begun, it’ll look like the ‘dose’ was
somethin’ prepared special for Benson. Ye haven’t
got a man t’ first base yet.”</p>

<p>“Just wait, Si——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“I am a-waitin’,” interrupted the harness-maker.
“An’ so be you, I guess. Doesn’t seem t’ be doin’
ye much good, though.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t got but two runs.”</p>

<p>“That’s jes’ two more’n you’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Wait till this inning is over.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m pretty good at waitin’. If you
get a fellow as far as third I’ll give ye a new saddle.”</p>

<p>“The saddle is mine. I’ll stop for it on my way
back t’ Benson.”</p>

<p>“An’ keep up th’ same waitin’ ye’ve been havin’,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Walter, as the two boys a few minutes
later together walked out to the field, “the keenness
of Si’s wit is almost too much for me. I don’t
know but I’d better go out under the shade of that
maple yonder and rest up.”</p>

<p>The young pitcher, however, neither responded
nor acted as if he saw anything unusual in the boasting
of the harness-maker. In a brief time the game
was resumed.</p>

<p>Again the first batter to face Dan struck out.
The second was hit with the ball, and a wild yell
arose from the boy with a pitchfork, who was still
standing near third base. “Now run, Zeb!” he
shouted to the player, who was on first base ruefully
rubbing his shoulder. “Never mind a little thing
like that! ’Twon’t hurt long! I’ll risk ye! If ye
get around home I’ll let ye ride back t’ Benson
on my new saddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Dan at that moment threw swiftly to his first-baseman,
but the runner, who perhaps was thinking
more of his bruised shoulder than of the game,
unfortunately was directly in the way of the ball
and was again hit by the swiftly thrown sphere.
Leaping to his feet with a yell, he shook his fist at
the pitcher and shouted, “Do that again an’ I’ll
knock yer head off!”</p>

<p>Instantly Dan threw the ball, which had been returned
to him, and the baseman touched the excited
runner, who had incautiously advanced a yard or
more toward the pitcher.</p>

<p>“You’re out,” said Moulton quietly as the man
was touched before he could regain the base.</p>

<p>“I hain’t neither!” roared the angry player as
he advanced threateningly toward the umpire.</p>

<p>Ignoring the protest, the umpire motioned to Dan
to resume his work and the young pitcher instantly
threw the ball.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called Moulton promptly.</p>

<p>“Look here, you!” said the angry player that had
been declared out at first. He had approached the
umpire and wrathfully was facing him. “Do you
know what I’d give you for two cents?”</p>

<p>“Get off the field,” said Moulton quietly, scarcely
glancing at him.</p>

<p>“I won’t get off! I tell ye I wa’n’t out at first.
No, sir! That fellow stood right in my way.”</p>

<p>“I told you to get off the field,” said Moulton
again in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Mebbe you’ll put me off.”</p>

<p>Lifting his hand in token that time was called,
Moulton turned to the angered player and said, “I
don’t want to make any trouble. If you don’t know
any better——”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m talkin’ about!” interrupted
the Bensonite. “I’m telling you I wa’n’t out on
first.”</p>

<p>“I called you out.”</p>

<p>“I know ye did, but that doesn’t make it so,
does it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Now leave the field and take your seat.”</p>

<p>The silence among the spectators was tense as
the eyes of everyone were turned toward the two
boys. “That’s Jim Fuller,” said the farmer boy
who, still holding his pitchfork in his hand, was
standing beside Silas near third base. “He’s the
best wrestler in Benson. That umpire doesn’t want
t’ rile him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ye worry none ’bout th’ umpire,” retorted
Silas promptly. “I rather guess he c’n give an’
’count o’ himself if he has to.”</p>

<p>Both became silent a moment as the protesting
Benson player looking angrily at Moulton, finally
said: “You’re a robber, but I’m goin’ t’ let ye have
your way this time. But if ye call me out again
when I hain’t out—why, jes’ look out for yerself.
That’s all I’ve got t’ say t’ ye.” As the Benson
player turned to seek the place where the fellow-members
of his nine were seated, a derisive shout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
from the Rodman supporters greeted him and he
instantly turned and faced the noisy crowd as he
shook his fist at them. The game was resumed
as Moulton quietly tossed the ball to Dan.</p>

<p>Whether it was due to the excitement or because
he was not keenly watching the batter Walter did
not know, but the third batter rapped a ball feebly
toward the short-stop and as Walter seized it and
threw it high above the head of the first-baseman
the runner gained second and then started toward
third.</p>

<p>“Get that ball! Don’t let th’ feller get third!
I don’t want t’ give up a new saddle!” roared
Silas.</p>

<p>Walter heard the shouts of Silas above the wild
yells of the dancing Bensonites, who were leaping
and slapping their thighs and emitting wild shouts
in their excitement. The first-baseman now had recovered
the ball and threw it fiercely to overtake the
runner. In his eagerness Walter leaped and caught
the ball, which had been thrown high, and as he
came down he fell directly upon the runner and
both lay sprawling upon the ground. Wriggling
from the place, the Benson player crawled over the
intervening yard and lay with his outstretched hand
grasping the third base. “Never touched me!”
he shouted triumphantly.</p>

<p>“He’s out,” said Moulton quietly. The player,
however, doggedly seated himself upon the base and
refused to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“Get off the field!” shouted Walter angrily.
“Don’t you know how to play ball?”</p>

<p>“You’re the whole thing, are you?” tauntingly
called the Benson player, who was calmly seated.
“Maybe you’ve come up into the country to show
us greenhorns how the game is played.”</p>

<p>“I know enough not to dispute the umpire,” retorted
Walter, his face flushing with anger.</p>

<p>“It’s your umpire. He isn’t giving us any show
at all. You didn’t touch me with the ball and you
know you didn’t!”</p>

<p>“I did touch you.”</p>

<p>“Go tell that to somebody that didn’t see it!”</p>

<p>By this time the players of both nines were assembled
near the third base, almost all of them
shouting and gesticulating wildly. Dan remained in
his position near the box, but he was the only
member of the Rodman nine who had not run to
join in the noisy altercation.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the midst of the confusion the runner
leaped to his feet and made a wild dash for the
plate. As there was no one there to prevent him
he easily crossed, and turning to the scorer shouted:
“That’s a run for us! Don’t forget to set down
that score for me. They can’t work that on us, not
when we have our eyes open!”</p>

<p>For a moment the confusion redoubled, the excited
spectators rushing upon the diamond and adding
their noisy claims or protests to the shouts of
the rival players.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Moulton now quietly approached the assembly,
and pushing his way into the midst of the throng
he said, “The runner was out.”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t either!” roared the captain of the
Benson nine. “Your man never touched him! He
wasn’t out!”</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Moulton advancing upon the
speaker. “You asked me to umpire this game,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” growled the captain, “but we
don’t intend to be robbed——”</p>

<p>“No one intends to rob you of anything,” broke
in Moulton in a low voice. “I saw the play. The
man was out, that is all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“No one else saw it,” growled the captain.</p>

<p>“That may be true, but it doesn’t change matters.
He was out. Now if you want to play ball go on
with the game. If you’d rather spend your time
wrangling like a lot of hoodlums, then that is your
privilege. Either go on with the game and tell your
men to play ball as gentlemen ought to play it or
give it up and quit.”</p>

<p>The angry captain glared at the umpire a moment,
then turned sulkily to his companions and
said: “Oh, well, come on, fellows! I suppose we’ll
have to give in, but we’ve got to play the umpire as
well as the Rodman nine.”</p>

<p>“I guess it isn’t the umpire, it’s the pitcher that
bothers those fellows,” said Walter to the third-baseman
as the Benson players sulkily walked to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
their positions on the field. “Dan is doing great
work!”</p>

<p>His words were overheard by the Benson player
who had been the cause of the interruption. Stopping
abruptly, he glared at Walter a moment and
then said: “I guess if the pitcher didn’t do any
better than your short-stop does, it wouldn’t take
long to wind up this game.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything, Walter,” said Dan as he
came to the side of his friend and quietly took his
arm. “When a fellow is in the game he wants to
work the muscles in his arms and legs and back, but
there are some other muscles he doesn’t want to let
get into the game at all.”</p>

<p>“You mean the muscles of his tongue?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I never dispute the umpire anyway,” said Walter,
his face flushing slightly as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t dispute the other nine. If there is any
disputing to be done, let them do it all.”</p>

<p>“But they were——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” broke in Dan. “But it doesn’t
pay. Besides, it’s part of the game to learn to control
one’s self.”</p>

<p>“Dan, you’re a wonder!” exclaimed Walter
good-naturedly. “If you’ll strike out the men in
one-two-three order the next inning, I’ll promise
not to say another word before the ninth inning.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best. You’re the first to bat.”</p>

<p>“Am I? I’d forgotten that in the excitement.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Seizing his bat Walter advanced to the plate, and in
his eagerness to redeem himself he struck at the
first ball and sent a slowly rolling grounder toward
second. The Benson second-baseman juggled the
ball and Walter’s speed increased as he dashed toward
first. He was aware of the shrill exhortations
of Silas to “hump himself,” whatever that might
mean, and just as he gained the base the ball was
caught by the baseman, who stood directly in front
of the base. The first-baseman was the one who
had made the trouble in the preceding inning, and
a grin appeared on his face as he looked at Walter.
For an instant Walter was intensely angry and
was about to voice his protest. The sight of Dan,
who had advanced to coach the runner, however,
instantly sobered him and he merely said, “A raw
deal, Dan,” as he passed his friend.</p>

<p>Dan scowled as he replied, “I know it, Walter,
but let it go.”</p>

<p>As he rejoined his companions Walter did not
refer to his recent experience and seated himself to
watch the progress of the game. A base on balls
and two hits netted two more runs and the stentorian
plaudits of the harness-maker were heard
over all the field. The Benson supporters were
strangely silent as their nine came in once more to
bat. There was little shouting until the first player
to face Dan received his base on balls. Then the
hopes of Benson revived and a wild yell followed
the player as he went to first base.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>A RECORD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Silence speedily swept over the assembly as
the next two batters both struck out. The
third batter managed to send a slow roller toward
first base, which speedily was taken by the baseman,
who did not return to his base, but stood
waiting on the line to touch the runner. The Benson
player attempted to run into the waiting player,
but the Rodman baseman stepped nimbly to one
side, avoiding the onslaught, although he succeeded
in touching the fleet-footed runner.</p>

<p>When Walter joined Dan, as the Rodman nine
came in from the field, his enthusiasm became still
more marked. “Dan,” he said, “can’t these fellows
bat any? Is that the reason for the exhibition
they’re making of themselves or is it because
you are pitching such a game?”</p>

<p>Dan smiled in his demure way, but did not directly
reply to the question of his friend. Whatever may
have been the trouble with the opposing nine the
Rodman players at least found little difficulty in
solving the curves of the pitcher that faced them.
As the game progressed the score of the Rodman
team steadily increased, while in every inning at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
least two of the Benson players struck out and the
sole hit they had made was a two-base hit in the
seventh inning. The prowess of the batter, however,
had been without avail, for he had been left
on second base, the two batters that followed him
having both been struck out. When the ninth inning
came the score stood fifteen to nothing in favor
of Rodman.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose your nerve now,” Walter said
to Dan as they resumed their places in the field for
the final inning.</p>

<p>Dan laughed good-naturedly and by way of reply
threw the ball swiftly to his friend at short, who
in turn threw it to first.</p>

<p>And yet Walter was suspicious of Dan, or at
least fearful. What a record he had made, with
only one hit and thirteen strike-outs in the eight
innings. There was slight danger that the game
would be lost, but if Dan should “go to pieces”
now the marvelous record might be spoiled. Dan
had not had much experience in pitching and it
would not be unnatural if, under the strain, he
should fail to maintain the steady success that thus
far had so wonderfully marked his work in the
game. The Benson supporters, as well as the Benson
nine, had ceased most of their noisy protests,
the failure of their batters to do anything with Dan’s
pitching being too manifest to be explained or even
defended. As for Walter’s part in the game, thus
far he had not covered himself with glory; he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
made two errors and not a hit had been placed
to his credit. It is true he had caught two high
twisting flies and had received vociferous applause
from Silas and his companions for his successful
attempts, but in the light of his condescending manner
at the beginning of the game and the freedom
with which he had lavishly given his instructions
he felt that he stood before the assembled spectators
in no very favorable light. Dan not only had pitched
a wonderful game, but had not failed once in hitting
the ball when he came to bat. Once he had
sent the ball far over the head of the left-fielder—a
hit which had brought him safely to third base,
and also won tumultuous applause from Silas, who
was the unrecognized leader of the cheering of the
Rodman supporters.</p>

<p>And now the final test for Dan had come. Would
he be able to keep up his good work? Walter
was nervous as Dan drew back to send in the
first ball.</p>

<p>Crack! The batter hit the ball with a force that
sent it skipping between short-stop and third base,
and the runner was safe at first, with the second
safe hit the Benson players had secured. The following
batter was given his base on balls, and the
runner at first slowly made his way to second. Two
on bases and none out! Had Dan’s hand lost its
cunning? “Steady, Dan,” called Walter, striving
to speak encouragingly. The young pitcher, however,
did not even glance in the direction of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
short-stop. With increased deliberation he drew
back his arm and sent in a slow in-curve.</p>

<p>Crack! Dan’s heart sank an instant at the sound,
and then he was aware that the ball was coming
swiftly toward him. He put up his hands almost
instinctively and, scarcely realizing what he was
doing, caught the ball. Instantly swinging about he
threw the ball to second and the player was out.
“First! First! Throw it to first!” shouted Dan
almost beside himself in his excitement. “Throw
it! Throw it!” he yelled frantically, going through
the motion of throwing the ball himself in his eagerness.</p>

<p>The second-baseman, at the sharp call, wheeled
and sent the ball with all his might to the first-baseman,
who had advanced several feet from the base
and was standing with outstretched hands awaiting
the coming of the sphere. The Benson runner who,
at the sound of the bat when it struck the ball, had
heedlessly started at full speed for second, now was
frantically endeavoring to regain first base. As
the baseman caught the ball the runner dove head-foremost,
and the two came down in a heap about
six feet from the coveted bag.</p>

<p>Dan was dimly aware of a mighty shout that went
up from the excited spectators, but he instantly
ran to the place where the two players were lying.
The Rodman player had been struck in the pit of
the stomach by the head of the Benson player and
was gasping for breath, his face being colorless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Work his feet, Dan,” called Walter as he himself
began to move the arms of the player much
after the manner in which the handle of a pump is
manipulated. There were expressions of anger
to be seen on the faces of the people that instantly
rushed upon the field, and for a moment there were
signs of serious trouble. Fortunately the Rodman
first-baseman quickly recovered and arose, though
he stood for a brief time pale and trembling. With
his recovery the threatening peril of a conflict was
avoided and slowly the assembly began to depart
from the field.</p>

<p>“Dan, that was a wonderful catch you made,”
said Walter quietly, as he joined his friend.</p>

<p>“Was it?” laughed Dan, elated by the words of
praise.</p>

<p>“Yes; though the best thing you did was when
you sent the ball like a shot to second,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“Nat Carey wasn’t asleep. He got the ball to
first in time to catch the runner. Nat played a
good game to-day at second.”</p>

<p>“That is the first time I ever saw a triple play.”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was great.”</p>

<p>“It saved the day, I guess.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to complain, Dan,” said Walter.
“Fifteen strike-outs shouldn’t make you blush.”</p>

<p>“I’m not blushing.”</p>

<p>“Ye didn’t do s’ bad after all,” roared Silas, at
that moment joining the boys and slapping Walter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
on the back as he spoke. “I thought long in th’
first o’ th’ game ye wasn’t worth shucks, but th’ way
ye took that liner an’ then giv’ it a heave t’ second
was pretty slick. What d’ye think o’ the Rodman
nine now?” he added triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I think the ‘nine’ consisted mostly of Dan and
his pitching.”</p>

<p>“Dan done noble,” admitted Silas, “but th’
trouble was he didn’t give none o’ th’ other fellows
a show. He struck out so many o’ th’ Benson chaps
that ’bout all th’ was left for our boys was t’ stan’
still an’ watch th’ Bensons walk up t’ th’ home plate,
sass th’ umpire, give their club a fling, an’ march
back an’ sit down.”</p>

<p>“Well, it came out all right, Silas,” laughed
Walter.</p>

<p>“Ye’re right it did. I told ye ’twould, didn’t
I? Neow what d’ye think ’bout what I said?”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>“That Dan ought t’ get th’ New Yorks t’ come
up here. I rather guess Dan could give their best
knockers somethin’ t’ think ’bout.”</p>

<p>Dan laughed lightly, and Walter said: “Silas,
I’m afraid you’re a little bit prejudiced in favor of
the Rodman nine.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Ye see what was done to the Benson
fellows, didn’t ye? That tells th’ whole story.”</p>

<p>“It might be a different story if we had been
playing a professional team like New York or
Chicago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“Prob’ly they’d got a run or two,” admitted Silas,
“but they couldn’t ’a’ batted Dan. Nobody could.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did well,” said Walter warmly as
he turned once more to his friend. “Dan,” he
added abruptly, “come over to the house this
evening, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“My father will be there. He’s coming up this
afternoon and I want you to meet him.”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you, but probably he won’t be
overanxious to see me. Why should he?”</p>

<p>“After you struck out fifteen men this afternoon?
Why, it’s like meeting the President or the King
of England!” exclaimed Walter enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t all. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p>“Will you come?” said Walter persistently.</p>

<p>“What time?”</p>

<p>“Any time after supper.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“I shall expect you!”</p>

<p>The boys separated, each starting for his home.
Walter’s elation over the result of the game was
great and manifested itself in the way in which
he walked along the road that led to his grandfather’s
farm, which was a half-mile or more from
the little village. His thoughts plainly were upon
some project in his mind, for he frequently exclaimed,
“Great! We’ll have something to show<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
next spring! The school will think I’ve made the
greatest find in years!”</p>

<p>As Walter turned into his grandfather’s yard
he saw his father and mother seated on the wide,
shaded veranda, and instantly he ran to greet them.
“When did you come?” he asked his father as
soon as he had warmly welcomed him.</p>

<p>“I arrived about half an hour ago. Been playing
ball, Walter?” Mr. Borden inquired, as he
glanced at his boy’s uniform.</p>

<p>Walter laughed as he replied, “I thought better
of you than that. What did you think I wore this
suit for? To hoe potatoes?”</p>

<p>“One might suspect something of the kind,” said
Mr. Borden smilingly. “It certainly couldn’t look
worse if you had been hoeing potatoes.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I got in sliding to second,” explained
Walter as he glanced at his discolored suit.
“I’m awfully glad you came, pop,” he added affectionately.
“I’ve got something to say to you.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked his father in mock seriousness
as he at once thrust his hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>“It isn’t money—at least, it isn’t money for me.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“You know Dan Richards, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Is he the boy that lives with his mother on the
farm yonder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s one of the finest fellows I ever
met.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he is. And he told me the other day
that he was saving up his money——”</p>

<p>“Did he explain how, clearly enough for you
to see?” broke in Mr. Borden good-naturedly. “I
shall be glad if——”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted Walter, “he’s saving his
money so that he can go to the normal school this
year and then he wants to go to college.”</p>

<p>“A very worthy ambition—if he has the root
of the matter in him.”</p>

<p>“He has. He’s one of the best fellows that ever
lived! He struck out fifteen men in to-day’s game!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he did! Now what I want is for you
to send him to the Tait School with me this year.”</p>

<p>“And he struck out fifteen men,” laughed Mr.
Borden.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I wish you might have seen him! It
was wonderful! And he’ll do well in school and
in college too! He’s one of those quiet fellows who
always do everything well.”</p>

<p>“That means a thousand dollars a year, Walter.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can cut down my allowance. He can
room with me. I’m sure he’d have a good influence
over me and you often say you care more for that
than you do for anything else.”</p>

<p>“I do, my boy. You’d better get ready for supper
now. We’ll talk about this matter later.”</p>

<p>“What a generous boy Walter is!” said his
mother fondly as her son departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“What makes you think that?” inquired her husband.</p>

<p>“Because he wants to help Dan. And Dan is a
good boy. He is fond of Walter, and I hear that he
is very good to his mother, who is a widow.”</p>

<p>“Likewise he struck out fifteen to-day,” retorted
Mr. Borden quizzically.</p>

<p>“What makes you laugh?” demanded Mrs. Borden
a little resentfully. “I’m sure I don’t know just
what that means, but it must be something good.”</p>

<small>STUDYING A BOY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“It is good, very good, indeed. It isn’t often a
young pitcher can do so well as that, but I fancy
he didn’t have any very skillful batters to face,”
laughed Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what ‘struck out’ means,” said
Mrs. Borden. “It doesn’t mean that Dan struck
anybody, does it?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure he is a good boy and I’m proud
of Walter that he wants to help Dan obtain an
education. For my part I think it shows a decidedly
generous nature.”</p>

<p>“I thought he wanted me to help Dan.”</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well what he meant.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I fancy I do,” said her husband good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“You are going to help him, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“It depends.”</p>

<p>“Upon what?”</p>

<p>“Upon what I find in the boy. I don’t know of
any better way to invest my money than to put it
into men. But there isn’t any use in trying to make a
successful man out of an incompetent or lazy boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“Dan isn’t lazy—I’m sure of that,” said Mrs.
Borden warmly. “Everybody around here knows
how hard he and Tom work on the farm.”</p>

<p>“Who is Tom?”</p>

<p>“He is Dan’s brother.”</p>

<p>“And does he too want to go to school and college?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard that he did. What Walter said
about Dan to-night is the first I’ve heard that Dan
wanted an education.”</p>

<p>“And he struck out fifteen in the game to-day,”
said Mr. Borden mockingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand what you mean, but you
say it isn’t anything bad.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it is quite remarkable.”</p>

<p>“Then why do you laugh?”</p>

<p>“Did I laugh?” asked Mr. Borden soberly.</p>

<p>“You know you did. It doesn’t seem to me quite
fair to Walter. I’m sure if he takes an interest in
helping Dan get an education you ought not to discourage
him.”</p>

<p>“Perish the thought, mother.”</p>

<p>“I never can tell whether you are serious or not.”</p>

<p>“I’m serious about one thing—I wish supper was
ready.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it must be, for I heard Martha say she
would have it by the time Walter came.”</p>

<p>“Well, Walter has come, but I don’t see any
signs of supper.”</p>

<p>“There! There’s the gong!” exclaimed Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
Borden as the musical sound of a Japanese gong
was heard from the dining-room. “You won’t
have to wait any longer. Here comes Walter.”</p>

<p>All hastened at once to the room where supper
was served and the food Martha had prepared
speedily began to disappear from the table.</p>

<p>“This is better than the city,” said Mr. Borden
after a brief time had elapsed. “It was very warm
there this morning. Here, the very view I have
from the window rests me. I sometimes think I’d
like to give up work and come up here and stay.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think of giving up work at your
age,” exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>“Not with one boy in the Tait School and another
that Walter is thinking of sending,” laughed
Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“You helped one of the boys in your office to go
to college,” suggested Walter.</p>

<p>“He was worth it—worth all I put into him.”</p>

<p>“So will Dan be.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen. I suppose I’ll have
a chance some time to see this prodigy—let me see,
was it eighteen he struck out to-day?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen,” replied Walter promptly. “Dan is
coming over here after supper.”</p>

<p>“Have you said anything to him?” asked Mr.
Borden sharply.</p>

<p>“No, sir; not a word.”</p>

<p>“That is wise. Well, we’ll soon find out whether
it’s another Daniel come to judgment or just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
another case of mistaken identity. You say he
struck out twenty men to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, fifteen.”</p>

<p>“So it was. How much do you pay this Dan
when you hire him to take you fishing on Six
Town Pond?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars a day.”</p>

<p>“Does he earn his money?”</p>

<p>“He does that!” exclaimed Walter with enthusiasm.
“The other day we got a pickerel that
weighed almost ten pounds and we saw a snake
almost as big as a fence rail.”</p>

<p>“You say ‘we’ got a ten-pound pickerel. Who
got it—you or Dan?”</p>

<p>“I caught it—though I don’t believe I’d have
landed it if it hadn’t been for him.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely. What did he do?”</p>

<p>“He just told me what to do.”</p>

<p>“Has he been studying any at night?” abruptly
asked Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“Every night,” replied Walter promptly.</p>

<p>“I’ll go over to his farm with you to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>“Dan said he might come over here to-night.”</p>

<p>“That is all right,” said Mr. Borden quietly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An hour later when the entire family was seated
on the piazza Dan appeared. He was quiet, almost
shy in his bearing, and as he accepted Mrs.
Borden’s invitation to a seat with the family he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
found himself sitting between Walter and his
father. Mr. Borden took little part in the conversation,
but Walter was positive that his father
was quietly observing his friend and consequently
was eager to have him make a good impression.
But Dan too was unusually silent even for him and
Walter was compelled to do most of the talking,
though it cannot be said that the task, for him,
was a difficult one.</p>

<p>At last Mr. Borden inquired, “Dan, how many
acres are in your farm?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-one, sir,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“All under cultivation?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We have a nine-acre wood-lot and
there are about twelve acres we use as pasture.
It’s rock land and the soil is thin.”</p>

<p>“What do you raise mostly?”</p>

<p>“Some wheat, considerable corn, and more potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Why do you raise potatoes?”</p>

<p>“Because I have a ready market and they pay
best. The soil is just right for them.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it is?”</p>

<p>“If you saw our potatoes I don’t think you’d
ask that question.”</p>

<p>“Did your father raise many potatoes?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“What made you try it then?”</p>

<p>“One of the Otis boys took the agricultural
course at college. When he was in college I asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
him to analyze some of the soil. It was when he
was a student and I don’t suppose his analysis
was absolutely correct. But he talked with his professors,
told them about our farm, how it was
located and all, and they advised trying potatoes as
a crop. We did—and we are satisfied.”</p>

<p>“You say you have a good market. Where is
it?”</p>

<p>“All over is about the best answer I can give you,
Mr. Borden. A good many people come up here
every summer from the city. I make arrangements
with a few of them to ship a barrel or two directly
to each family every fall.”</p>

<p>“Do you get the market price?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; after taking out the freight.”</p>

<p>“Market price here or of the wholesalers or
retailers in the city?”</p>

<p>“The retail price in the city.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that is a little too much?”
laughed Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“They pay us just what they’d have to pay at
a grocery store, and our potatoes are better.”</p>

<p>“Is that what your customers say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; and we don’t have any small potatoes
in the bottom of the barrel.”</p>

<p>“That’s something worth thinking of. My boy
tells me you played a great game of ball to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; the nine did well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Walter says you made up the nine.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you that? Walter himself began
a triple play in the ninth inning that probably saved
my record.”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall if he did.”</p>

<p>“What is a triple play?” inquired Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“It’s when you get three out right together,”
explained Walter.</p>

<p>“Of course. I ought to have known that,” said
Mrs. Borden. “How far ‘out’ do they have to go?
I could hear the boys this afternoon. They were
not very far out from the village.”</p>

<p>“Not very far, mother,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“I must come over and see your potatoes, Dan,”
said Mr. Borden. “Are they doing well this
season?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Dan replied, “though we’ve had a
hard fight with the bugs. I never saw them worse
than they are this summer.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>For an hour or more the party remained on the
piazza, Mr. Borden taking only an occasional part
in the conversation, which Walter did not suffer to
lag. Dan, absolutely unaware that Mr. Borden was
listening and watching with a purpose, was quiet in
his manner, speaking less frequently than his friend
and then in fewer words. It was plain that he enjoyed
the evening, for Walter’s mother, as well as
the other members of the family, by their manifest
friendliness and interest, made him less conscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of himself, and the quiet boy entered after his own
manner into the spirit of the group.</p>

<p>After Dan’s departure Mrs. Borden said to her
husband, “Well, what do you think of Dan? To
me he seems to be an unusually fine boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“Are you going to help him through school?”</p>

<p>“I thought Walter was planning to do that,”
laughed Mr. Borden quietly.</p>

<p>“I am proud that my boy is so generous,” said
Mrs. Borden warmly. “He wants to help his
friend.”</p>

<p>“How many was it that Dan struck out?” asked
Mr. Borden soberly as he turned to his boy.
“Twenty-one, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; fifteen,” replied Walter promptly.</p>

<p>“So it was,” assented Mr. Borden. “That is a
good record.”</p>

<p>“But Dan is more than a good ball-player,” asserted
Walter. “He is a hard worker and he has
the best head on him I ever saw. He never loses
his head in a game, he doesn’t dispute the umpire or
yell at the fellows——”</p>

<p>“Do you ever do that, Walter?” broke in Mr.
Borden.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I do,” admitted Walter shamefacedly.</p>

<p>“All boys shout, I hear them every day,” spoke
up Mrs. Borden. “I am sure Walter does no
more than other boys of his age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Not in your ears, mother,” laughed her husband.
“Ask Walter what he thinks about it. He ought to
know.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is whether or not you
are going to help Dan.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say as yet.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I must see more of him first. It would be no
real kindness to Dan to take him away from the
farm, where I fancy he is doing fairly well, and put
him into some other work in which he might fail.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you believed in education,” protested
Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“I do,” said her husband simply.</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see——” began Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“Education and school and college are not always
the same thing.”</p>

<p>“But schools are to provide education.”</p>

<p>“They provide opportunities,” said Mr. Borden
quietly. “If a boy goes to school and doesn’t use
his opportunities, the fact that he has attended or
even been graduated from a certain institution
doesn’t make him an educated man, does it? Education
is like the water in a trough—if a horse
doesn’t drink it, it doesn’t make any difference how
many times he has been led to it or what a fine
trough the water is in. No horse quenches his
thirst except by drinking.”</p>

<p>“What is an education then?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can best answer that question by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
telling what a certain great college president explained
it to be. He said there are four great processes
or operations of a boy’s mind which education
ought to develop if it is to fulfil its best purpose—the
first is observing accurately, the second is recording
correctly, the next is the ability to compare
and group and draw a correct inference, and the
last is the ability to express clearly and forcefully
what he has learned.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think Dan can do all that? I’m sure
Walter can,” affirmed Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“Can he?” said Mr. Borden quizzically. “Well,
if he can then he is educated already and I shall
not need to send him to school any more. As for
Dan, I must see more of him. The most I know
now is that he struck out fifteen men to-day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>MR. BORDEN DECIDES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Bright and early the following morning, Mr.
Borden, accompanied by Walter, went to
Dan’s home. Eager as Walter was to talk about the
prospect of his friend being enrolled as a pupil in
the Tait School he did not refer to the matter which
was uppermost in his thoughts. The clear warm air
of the summer morning, the green of the fields of
waving corn, the sight of the well-fed and contented
cattle in the pastures, the songs of the birds in the
treetops—all were so attractive to the man who had
found a brief respite from the cares of his office in
the city that somehow Walter was aware that his
father had no desire to talk. Accordingly, the two
walked in silence and in a brief time stood before
the open door of the kitchen in Dan’s home, where
his mother was busily engaged in her morning
tasks.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Richards,” called Mr. Borden,
who already had a slight acquaintance with
Dan’s mother. “Walter and I were taking a morning
stroll and stopped for a moment to look about
us here.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Borden,” responded Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Richards, advancing to the door and drying her
arms on a towel as she did so. There was no
apology for being found doing this, and simply and
cordially she said, “Won’t you come in?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Mr. Borden. “I think I
understand what it means to be interrupted in a
busy hour. No, we’ll not come in, but if you don’t
object we’ll take a walk about your place and look
up the boys.”</p>

<p>“They are in the field, yonder,” she said pointing
to a distant part of the little farm. “We call
it the ten-acre lot.”</p>

<p>“They appear to be busy too,” suggested Mr.
Borden.</p>

<p>“They are, but not too busy to see their friends.
I’ll call them,” she added as she reached for a long
tin horn that was hanging on the kitchen wall.</p>

<p>“No! not by any means!” said Mr. Borden
hastily. “Don’t disturb the boys. We shall find
them easily. It is all slightly different from what
I find in my office,” he added smilingly. “There,
I’m afraid the boys are more likely to stop work
before the horn sounds.”</p>

<p>“My boys are good workers—they have to be,”
said Mrs. Richards simply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand. It is hard when the head of
the family is gone.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that only, though of course Dan and
Tom feel more responsibility than they would if
their father had lived. But they are both interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
in the farm, though Dan is interested in his
books too.”</p>

<p>“Which is he more interested in—the farm or his
books?”</p>

<p>“Books.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he too tired to study when night comes,
after working so hard all day?”</p>

<p>“If he is he doesn’t say anything about it. Since
young Mr. Moulton has been here he has been
helping Dan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s been showing Dan how to pitch too,”
broke in Walter.</p>

<p>“So he has,” said Mrs. Richards smilingly.
“You’d think those boys had had enough work
when night comes, but they go out behind the barn
almost every night after supper and Dan will throw
a ball to Tom with all his might and keep it up for
an hour at a time. I hear Mr. Moulton talking to
them, but I can’t seem to make head or tail of what
he is saying. It’s mostly about inshoots and fade-aways
and drop-balls and spitballs. When I was a
girl in school the boys used to throw spitballs. I
guess you could see some of ’em still sticking to
the ceiling of the old Pine Tree schoolhouse. But
Mr. Moulton and Tom and Dan seem to take it all
seriously, though for my part I can’t see how or
why. But then,” she added complacently, “they’re
boys and I’m just a middle-aged woman, an’ it isn’t
natural to think I’d be interested in the things that
interest my boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“You are interested in the boys though, I fancy,”
suggested Mr. Borden smiling as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be fit to be their mother if I wasn’t.
They’re both good boys. There, I’ve talked enough
about my own flesh and blood. I wish you would
come in. I have some fresh buttermilk—right from
the churn.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stop and have some on our way back if
that will not be too much trouble,” said Mr. Borden
as he and Walter turned away.</p>

<p>As they came to the barn and sheds Mr. Borden
glanced keenly at the objects in view. “Dan and
Tom appear to be taking good care of their belongings,”
he said quietly. “The wagons are all under
cover and there’s no litter about the place. Let me
step inside the barn a moment,” he added as he
entered the rude building.</p>

<p>Walter looked rather eagerly into his father’s face
when Mr. Borden came out of the barn, but as his
father smiled and did not refer to what he had seen
inside the building he did not voice the question he
was eager to ask.</p>

<p>As the two drew near the place where Dan and
his brother were hoeing, the young farmers did not
stop their labors as they pleasantly greeted their
visitors.</p>

<p>“We are on our way back home and just stopped
a moment to look at your potato-field,” Mr. Borden
explained. “You certainly have a promising
crop, boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Dan glancing with pride at
the long and well-cultivated rows. “We have had
an unusually good summer.”</p>

<p>“Is this the last hoeing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’ll still have to fight the bugs, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Dan smiling as he spoke. “They
keep us from getting lazy. I don’t know what
they were made for anyway.”</p>

<p>“When you do find out you must not forget to
let the rest of us know. You might investigate
mosquitoes and a few other creatures while you are
at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are a sure cure for taking things
too easily.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” laughed Mr. Borden. “Some of
us think we don’t need any whip or spur for that.
Have you ever been in the city, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Never in New York.”</p>

<p>“Like it better here I fancy.”</p>

<p>“I never expect to find anything I like as well
as I do this place.”</p>

<p>“Then you are planning to stay here, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“I recall that Walter told me you were going to
the normal school this fall.”</p>

<p>“I want to go.”</p>

<p>“If you are so fond of the farm why do you
leave it?”</p>

<p>“A farmer ought to be more than his farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“It pays to put money into a farm. It ought to
pay better to put money into a farmer.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can explain, though I see
what I mean,” said Dan thoughtfully. “I have an
idea that an education helps to set a man’s brains
in working order.”</p>

<p>“It ought to,” assented Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“That is what I want.”</p>

<p>“So you are going to the normal school to work,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t expect to dodge any classes or
slip along as easily as possible?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I may do, but I know what
I need and what I want too. I want to get my
brains into as good working order as I have the
muscles in my right arm.”</p>

<p>“Walter told me you struck out fifteen yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Dan simply.</p>

<p>“Come on, Walter; we must be going,” said Mr.
Borden turning to his boy.</p>

<p>Bidding the young farmers good morning the
visitors at once departed, walking toward the rail
fence which they speedily climbed, and then following
the course of the noisy brook they returned
to the bridge.</p>

<p>“Dan seems to be a quiet fellow,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Borden as he and Walter halted on the bridge and
looked down into the swiftly flowing water.</p>

<p>“He is,” exclaimed Walter eagerly. “There
isn’t a bit of brag in his whole make-up. Everybody
likes him. And he has hardly been out of sight
of Rodman in all his life.”</p>

<p>“Time enough for that later. Why do you want
him to go to the Tait School? Why not let him
go on and do as he is planning?”</p>

<p>“Go to the normal school?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have him with me.”</p>

<p>“How many did he strike out?” asked Mr.
Borden quizzically.</p>

<p>“Fifteen.”</p>

<p>“And you think he’d do that for the Tait School
nine?”</p>

<p>“I’d like him to have a chance to show what he
can do.”</p>

<p>“Walter, if Dan hadn’t struck out fifteen yesterday
would you have wanted him to enter the Tait
School this year?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Walter in some confusion.
“Of course, I’d like our nine to have him.
But his pitching isn’t all there is to Dan. He’s——”</p>

<p>“I can understand that,” broke in Mr. Borden.
“Come, Walter, we mustn’t keep your grandmother’s
dinner waiting.” As they at once started
toward the farmhouse Walter was eager to ask
his father what his decision was, but as Mr. Borden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
walked thoughtfully along the roadside his boy
looked at him keenly and decided to wait before he
made any further inquiries. Indeed, Mr. Borden
did not again refer to the matter until just before
his departure for the city. He had been away from
the farmhouse twice, but he had gone by himself
each time, and did not refer to what he had been
doing.</p>

<p>“Walter,” Mr. Borden said as he was preparing
for his departure, “I have decided to let you tell
Dan that he can go to the Tait School this coming
year.”</p>

<p>“Great!” shouted Walter in his delight. “I
was sure you would do it when you found out what
kind of a fellow Dan is.”</p>

<p>“I have talked with two or three who know him
well—Mr. Moulton among others. Their reports
are all favorable to Dan, but the one thing that
more than any other influenced me was what I
found he was doing in the work on the farm.
Walter, he will room with you.”</p>

<p>“Just what I want.”</p>

<p>“You know, he has not been accustomed to some
things that are a part of your life. He may appear
a bit awkward at first——”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk all that!” broke in the boy in his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mr. Borden smiled and said: “Very well, Walter.
There is much that you and Dan can teach each
other and I’ve no doubt each of you will try to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
a teacher. Whether or not either of you will be a
very apt scholar remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You will a little later.”</p>

<p>“It’s good of you to do this for Dan.”</p>

<p>“Is it? Your mother says you are the one that is
doing it. Don’t forget that, Walter. Good-bye; I’ll
see you soon and I shall be interested in hearing
about your talk with Dan.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Borden was to accompany her husband
to the station, Walter at once started for Dan’s
home. He was highly elated over his father’s decision,
though he had been confident that his consent
would be granted. It was seldom that Walter
met a rebuff in the family in which he was an only
child.</p>

<p>He stopped a moment on the bridge that spanned
the brook and saw Dan coming from the fields to
his house. The sight of his friend aroused his enthusiasm
once more, and turning into the near-by lot
Walter began to run. As he came near, he shouted
in his eagerness, “Dan! Dan! Wait a minute! I’ve
got something to tell you!”</p>

<p>Dan stopped as he heard the call, and in a brief
time his friend ran to him. “What’s wrong?” inquired
Dan in his quiet way as he became aware of
the excitement under which Walter was laboring.</p>

<p>“I’ve got some great news for you, Dan,” panted
Walter.</p>

<p>“For me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir! For you and me too. You’re going to
the Tait School this year. You’re to room with me.
You’ll be the pitcher on the nine and the biggest
‘find’ we’ve ever had. Oh, it’s immense, Dan! I
just——”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” interrupted Dan. “I’m not
very clear what you mean.”</p>

<p>“You are to go to the Tait School this year and
room with me.”</p>

<p>“How am I to go?”</p>

<p>“My father is to send you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he is to pay for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. That’s it exactly. He’s going to send
you and you’re to room with me. Why? What’s
wrong about that? It’s just as I’m telling you!”
exclaimed Walter somewhat aghast as Dan slowly
shook his head.</p>

<small>A REFUSAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“I can’t do it,” said Dan soberly.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it!” exclaimed Walter. “You
can’t help yourself! You’re going to the Tait
School! You’re going to room with me; you’re going
to pitch on our nine and——”</p>

<p>“It’s good of you, Walter; but I can’t, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“It costs too much. I simply can’t do it. I can
go to the normal school——”</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontispiece">“But, man, you aren’t going to pay the bills!”</a>
interrupted Walter.</p>

<p>“Who will pay them?”</p>

<p>“My father.”</p>

<p>Dan was silent a moment, looking down at the
ground at his feet. When he glanced at his friend
again he said, “That’s too much, Walter. It’s too
much for your father——”</p>

<p>“You don’t know my father!” broke in Walter
impulsively. “He has whole barrels of money.
Why, Dan, only last month he cleaned up a cool
hundred thousand in a deal——”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s his money, not mine.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, and if he chooses to take one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
per cent of what he made on that deal and put it
into your education, why, that’s his business too,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not entirely.”</p>

<p>“Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“Partly mine.”</p>

<p>“No, sir!” declared Walter emphatically. “It’s
none of your business! My father has a right to
spend his own money just as he wants to, hasn’t
he? I’ve heard him say a million times that all
money was good for anyway was just to use. Don’t
be foolish, Dan.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to be. I can’t tell you how much
I appreciate what you’ve just said to me. But,
Walter, there’s another side and you haven’t thought
of that.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any other side!” declared Walter
promptly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t everything have at least two sides?”
asked Dan quizzically.</p>

<p>“No, sir!”</p>

<p>“What hasn’t, for example?”</p>

<p>“This offer I’m making you. Why, Dan, it’s
the chance of a lifetime. You’ve never been out
of Rodman except to go over to Benson or to Simpson’s
Corners to play ball. You don’t know anything
of what the world is like.” Unaware of the
dull flush that spread over Dan’s cheeks as he spoke,
Walter continued eagerly: “Why, man alive, the
Tait School is the greatest school in the United<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
States! There isn’t another that can hold a candle
to it! Why, our nine whipped the freshman nine of
every one of the big colleges. We’ve had more men
enter college without conditions in the last five years
than any other prep school. We’ve got the best
teachers, the finest buildings, the greatest crowd of
fellows. Why, Dan, you simply don’t know what
you’re talking about! You’re turning down a chance
that hundreds of fellows would jump at. You can’t
mean it! If you talk it over with Moulton, he’ll
tell you that if you are fool enough to say no it’ll
just show that you haven’t brains and aren’t fit to
go to school anywhere, not even to the normal school
that you seem to think is one of the big institutions
of the land. I’m not going to say another word to
you about it now. When you think it over and
tell your mother and Tom and Moulton about it you
won’t have a peg left to hang your hat on.”</p>

<p>“It’s good of you anyway, Walter,” said Dan
quietly. “Don’t forget that I appreciate all you
say.”</p>

<p>“No! You don’t half appreciate it or you
wouldn’t pull off the way you’re doing. Honestly,
Dan, is there a single real reason why you can’t say
‘yes’ right off the bat?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I can make you see it, Walter,
but it’s too much to take when I know it will be
a long time before I can pay back the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“But you don’t have to pay it back! You don’t
even have to think of that! My father will pay
every cent of the term-bills!”</p>

<p>“Walter, did you ever think of what it means
for a fellow to be poor and have to take what some
one else gives him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have,” replied Walter more
seriously. “Though when it comes to that,” he
added lightly, “I haven’t very many shekels myself,
except my allowance.”</p>

<p>“That’s different.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is—after a fashion. I never thought
very much about it anyway.”</p>

<p>“If I should offer to give you my yearling colt
would you take her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t,” said Dan positively.</p>

<p>“That’s different too. In the first place, you
couldn’t afford to give Ban away. She’s too valuable——”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not it!” interrupted Dan. “You
wouldn’t be thinking as much of me as you would
of yourself. You’d be saying to yourself, ‘I can’t
take Ban. It’s too much to take as a gift.’ Now,
be honest, Walter, isn’t that really just what you’d
think?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I might,” admitted Walter, “but that
has nothing to do with this case.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! You see——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t just see. I tell you, old man, it’s good
of you and your father, but I want you to think of
my side too.”</p>

<p>“Dan, you’re an obstinate old——”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re another.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, either! You just pull back like a balky
mule!”</p>

<p>“While you’re pulling just as hard the other
way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be sorry some day and call yourself seven
kinds of a fool! It isn’t every day in the week a
fellow gets the chance to turn down such an offer
as you’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose I know that?” asked Dan
softly, as he became aware that his disappointed
friend was becoming angry.</p>

<p>“You’ll be sorry when it’s too late, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“That may be true.”</p>

<p>“It will be true! It is true! I simply can’t
understand how any fellow can be such a fool as to
throw over a chance to go to the Tait School, especially
when the chances are that he’ll be the pitcher
on the school nine. And, Dan,” Walter continued
eagerly, “there hasn’t been a pitcher on the Tait
School team who hasn’t been a varsity pitcher after
he entered college. There’s Moulton, for example—oh,
I’m not going to say anything more about it.
If you could only see the Tait School just once
you’d be perfectly willing for your old normal
school to go to the hayseeds where it belongs. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
think it over. I’ll see you again sometime. I’m
going back to my grandfather’s now.”</p>

<p>As Walter turned away abruptly, and without
once looking behind him, he was not aware that
Dan remained standing in the place where the conversation
had taken place and was ruefully watching
his friend as he walked rapidly back to the old
bridge.</p>

<p>“Well, Walter, what did Dan say when you told
him what your father was going to do for him?”
inquired Mrs. Borden cheerily as her boy entered his
grandfather’s house.</p>

<p>“He said he wouldn’t do it,” replied Walter
somewhat tartly.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, that’s exactly what he said.”</p>

<p>“Why did he say that?”</p>

<p>“You can search me! Dan is as obstinate as a
pig in a garden. He’s the most unreasonable fellow
I know anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you did your part. It was noble of
you to want to help Dan to obtain an education. I
said that to your father——”</p>

<p>“What did father say when you told him?”
broke in Walter.</p>

<p>“He laughed, and all he said was Dan had fifteen
hit-outs in the game.”</p>

<p>“Strike-outs, I guess you mean, mother.”</p>

<p>“Is there any difference between a strike and
a hit? I should think they meant pretty much the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
same thing. If you were to strike another boy
you’d be hitting him, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I might strike at him without hitting him.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Mrs. Borden dubiously. “Well, I
shouldn’t let it trouble me, Walter. You were
generous, I’m sure. I think it was noble of you
and you made me feel very proud. Probably when
your father comes up for the week-end he’ll be able
to persuade Dan, though it does seem a little strange
that one should have to persuade a boy to take what
you are giving him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Dan! He’s the most obstinate
and unreasonable boy in seven kingdoms.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged, my boy. Your father will
find some way. He always does.”</p>

<p>Whether Walter was “discouraged” or not he
did not explain, though he did not go near Dan’s
home before the end of the week brought the return
of Mr. Borden to the old homestead. His first
word to his father, when Walter went in the automobile
to meet him at the station, was, “Dan won’t
do it.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he?” inquired Mr. Borden with a smile
and not seeming at all surprised.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He’s as obstinate as an old mule.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t quite so bad as that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is! I never saw such a fellow as Dan
is. He doesn’t say much, but when he takes his
stand you can’t budge him an inch. I don’t see
why he turns down such a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“It may be that he will change his mind. What
did you say when you told him of the offer?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember. I didn’t say very much.
I just told him what you had said. Probably I
didn’t put it strongly enough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Borden laughed and said, “Never mind, my
boy. I’ll have a little talk with Dan.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, father! I don’t know that
it will do any good, but there’s no harm in trying
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Let me see—how many was it that Dan struck
out in the game with the Benson nine?”</p>

<p>“You know already,” replied Walter a trifle
tartly.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Fifteen.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good record. Well, I’ll see Dan soon.”</p>

<p>Walter’s eagerness and impatience increased
when apparently his father forgot or ignored his
promise. Not a word concerning his promised interview
was said that evening nor on the morning
following. It was late Saturday afternoon when
Mr. Borden told his boy that he was about to go
to Dan’s home and that he wished to go alone.</p>

<p>“You’ll need me,” pleaded Walter. “You don’t
know Dan as well as I do.”</p>

<p>“Not in the same way, is what you mean,
Walter.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go.”</p>

<p>“I’d be glad to have you, but it will be better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
for you to stay here. If I have to do more afterward
I may call in your help, but I’m sure, my boy,
much as you think of Dan you would hinder more
than you would help if you were to accompany me
this time. I am not without hope that I’ll have a
good word for you when I come back. Please tell
me once more, Walter, how many Dan struck out in
the Benson game.”</p>

<p>“You know already.”</p>

<p>“So I do. It was fifteen, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is the record?”</p>

<p>“For strike-outs?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There have been quite a good many ‘no hit’
games. I don’t know just what the record for
strike-outs is. It might be——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Dan will make it when he becomes the
pitcher of the Tait School nine,” suggested Mr. Borden
good-naturedly. “Don’t give up too easily,
Walter. One never can tell what may come, but in
business I have learned at least one thing which
would have been of help to you if you had known
it before your interview with Dan.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Never give the ‘other fellow’ the chance to say
‘no.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can help it sometimes.”</p>

<p>“That’s one of the things you have to learn by
experience. Now I’ll go over to see the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
‘strike-out’ pitcher. Let me see now; I must be
sure of my ground. Was it twenty that Dan struck
out?”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t tell you any more that it was fifteen,”
replied Walter a little crossly as he became
aware that his father was good-naturedly making
fun of him.</p>

<p>“Where will you be, Walter, when I come
back?”</p>

<p>“Right here on the piazza.”</p>

<small>DAN RECONSIDERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">An hour had elapsed when Walter, who had
not once left the piazza where he and his
mother had been seated, exclaimed excitedly, “There
he comes, mother! I hope he has had good luck.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure your father has induced the foolish
boy to accept his offer. He has a great way of
dealing with men, though I must confess that I
haven’t very much sympathy with Dan. It seems
to me that he has been a very foolish boy even to
hesitate a moment. I’m sure he never will have
another such opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Dan, mother,” said Walter as
he arose and ran down the steps to greet his father.
“What luck, father?” he asked eagerly. “Did you
get Dan to say he would go?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Great!” shouted the excited boy. “We’ll make
you an honorary member of the nine! How did
you do it? What did Dan say?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say very much.”</p>

<p>“But he really is going?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find him next September in your room
when you go back to school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me how you did it!”</p>

<p>“I can’t do that just now. Isn’t it enough for
you to know that Dan is to enter the Tait School
this fall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I’d like to know how you got him
to say yes.”</p>

<p>“He won’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t, either?”</p>

<p>“Not just now.”</p>

<p>“When will you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps at Christmas, perhaps next summer, or
it may be that you never will know.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“That’s another thing you may never know,
though I don’t mind telling you that I think you will
find out.”</p>

<p>“How? When?”</p>

<p>“You must wait. I have succeeded in getting
Dan to go to school with you. Can’t you be content
with that?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to be,” said Walter, “though I’d like
to know the rest. May I go over then and talk it
over with Dan?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go now!” exclaimed Walter as he ran
from the piazza.</p>

<p>“John, what did you say to Dan?” inquired Mrs.
Borden of her husband, as he seated himself in a
chair beside her.</p>

<p>“Well, I told Dan for one thing that he was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
acting wisely in turning down the chance I gave
him. I told him there was a difference between
begging and receiving. That it sometimes was more
gracious to receive than it was to give.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand you, John,” said Mrs. Borden
a little impatiently. “One would think to hear
you that it was Dan conferring the favor and not
you or Walter.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I did tell him,” said Mr.
Borden quietly.</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“I did. I told him that I knew as well as he
that Walter was an only child and spoiled by his
mother——”</p>

<p>“I don’t do any more for him than you do,
John,” protested Mrs. Borden.</p>

<p>“I know that. We both do too much. The boy
would be better off if he did more for himself, but
I haven’t the strength of character to do what I
know I ought to do. I didn’t have, when I was a
boy, a fraction of what Walter has. My father
made me work for almost everything I had. I
didn’t like it then, but he was a wiser as well as a
better man than I am.”</p>

<p>“There couldn’t be a more generous man than
you, John.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t there?” laughed Mr. Borden. “Well,
I told Dan that I knew as well as he did that Walter
is conceited and selfish—he thinks a good deal more
of himself than of anyone else——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“You didn’t tell him that!”</p>

<p>“I most certainly did. I told him Walter needed
some things that Dan had——”</p>

<p>“What, for example?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter doesn’t work, he’s too easily turned
aside, he gives up when he ought to hang on, he is
vain as a peacock, and he hasn’t the remotest idea
of the existence of anyone besides himself on this
planet.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t say that about your own boy!”</p>

<p>“Not in those words, but Dan knew what I meant.
Then I told him that he could help Walter, and I
felt that if he should get my boy into a steadier way
of working I’d be glad to pay him a good deal more
than the amount his year at the Tait School will
cost me. I put it so strongly that at last Dan agreed
to try it a year. If I should not be satisfied then he
is to leave the school and call off the bargain and he
even suggested that he would pay back what I might
have advanced——”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t pay it. He hasn’t any money.”</p>

<p>“Not just now. He’ll have plenty later. Likewise,
he struck out fifteen men in the Benson
game!” Mr. Borden added laughingly as he arose.
“Oh, it’s Walter’s chance as well as Dan’s, but I
don’t want you to tell Walter what I have just now
told you. It might spoil my plan.”</p>

<p>“I think Walter is a good boy. I can’t understand
you when you find so much fault with your
own flesh and blood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Mother,” said Mr. Borden softly, “sometimes it
costs one more to be true than it does to say or
do pleasing things. Ever think of that?”</p>

<p>“Of course I have, but I don’t see what that has
to do with Walter.”</p>

<p>“Trust me—you will see it and more clearly than
I do now.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Walter had gone to Dan’s home, and
as he entered the yard he saw his friend just coming
out of the barn. He was carrying a pail of milk in
each hand and his appearance, dressed as he was in
his overalls and without any hat, for the first time
impressed his friend with a vague sense of unfitness.
What would Sinclair Bradley (called “Sin” by his
fellows for more reasons than one) say if he should
see Walter’s new roommate in his present garb?
Walter vaguely thought also of the remarks which
others of his classmates might make, but his feeling
of vague uneasiness speedily departed as he ran
forward to greet Dan. The thought of fifteen
strike-outs was vastly stronger at the moment than
that of the remarks of his friends over Dan’s somewhat
uncouth appearance.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan!” called Walter lightly as he approached.
“I’ve heard the good news! You’re
going to the Tait School with me this fall.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you get excited, Dan?” Walter demanded
as he walked beside his friend toward the
milk-room, which was an addition to the old farmhouse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
built of stone and provided with ice which
Dan and his brother cut every winter from the mill-pond
not far away.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am, more than you think,” replied
Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You’re as cool when you face
the prospect of rooming with me as you are when
you face the heaviest hitter on the other nine and
have three men on bases.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” Dan spoke quietly, and Walter, in
his own feeling of elation, perhaps failed to look
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>“Yes. You wouldn’t be, if you knew what you
are going into.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” said Dan soberly.</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” exclaimed Walter, enthusiastic
once more in the company of his friend.
“You’ll like the fellows immensely. Right across
the hall from us will be Owen Pease and Sin Bradley’s
room. You’ll like both of them. Owen plays
in the field on the nine. He’s about ten feet long
and two inches wide.”</p>

<p>“I should think he’d go with Barnum. I never
saw a man built on that plan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ve put it a little strong,” laughed
Walter. “But he’s length without breadth or thickness.
Honestly, Dan, he’s the thinnest person you
ever saw.”</p>

<p>“But I never saw him.”</p>

<p>“You will, soon. Thinner than anyone I ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
saw then; put it that way if you want to. When we
were playing the Colt nine this spring Owen was
scared, at least he said he was, to face the pitcher.
He did throw a wicked ball, Dan, there’s no mistake
about that. I felt a little nervous myself when
I faced him. But Owen made such a time over it
and said he was afraid of being hit that Sin took
a bat and stuck it up on the ground right in front
of Owen and said, ‘Here, old man, you just hide
behind that and you’ll be safe.’”</p>

<p>“Did he get all his ten feet behind one bat?”</p>

<p>“He might as far as his thickness was concerned.
Owen is the thinnest chap I ever saw, just as I told
you, but he’s made of wire and steel.”</p>

<p>“Who is this ‘Sin’ you speak of?”</p>

<p>“Sin Bradley.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call him ‘Sin’?”</p>

<p>“His full name is Sinclair,” laughed Walter, “but
I guess the name fits him all right just as it is. You
never saw such a fellow in all your life, Dan. He’s
up to more tricks than you can dream of. One day
there was a fellow on the campus who was begging,
pretending he was a deaf-mute——”</p>

<p>“How do you know he was ‘pretending’?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m telling you. Sin saw through
his game before the beggar could get a chance. He
just walked up to him and jumped on his toes. I’m
telling you, Dan, that he wasn’t ‘mute’ for a spell
there. He called Sin all kinds of names in about a
thousand different languages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“He must have been pretty well educated to use
as many different languages as that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, probably it wasn’t quite a thousand,”
laughed Walter. “But the air was full of owskis
and oskis there for about five minutes.”</p>

<p>“What did Sin do?”</p>

<p>“He went up to the beggar, sober as a judge,
and begged his pardon. He told him how deeply
he regretted the ‘accident’ and then said, ‘I feel
worse about it because you are deaf and dumb.
How long have you had this trouble?’</p>

<p>“‘More as dree year,’ muttered the fellow, caught
off his guard. You ought to have heard the fellows
yell.”</p>

<p>“What did the deaf-and-dumb man do?”</p>

<p>“Started for some vast wilderness, I guess. We
heard about him afterward, though. He got on a
street-car in the city the next day and he still had
his big card placard on, ‘Please help a poor man
who is deaf and dumb.’ There were some good
people on the car and one of them suggested that
they chip in and help the fellow. This man was a
minister and he said it was a great pity that one
who was so young should suffer from such a terrible
affliction. The deaf-mute kept mum, pretending
that he didn’t hear any of the talk, but just before
they turned the money over to him a big fat man
got on the car and when it started it threw him
against the beggar and he brought one of his big
feet down hard on the mute’s left foot. ‘Ouch!’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
yelled the beggar. ‘You old fat porcupine; can’t
you look where you’re going?’”</p>

<p>“What happened to the poor fellow then?” inquired
Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, the good people hurried him off to the
police court. Sin said he would have walked a
thousand miles just to see the fellow when he was
brought up before the magistrate.”</p>

<p>“How far?” said Dan quizzically.</p>

<p>“You’re too literal, Dan,” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“Tell me about the teachers,” said Dan after he
and his friend had joined Mrs. Richards and Tom
on the piazza.</p>

<p>“Oh, they are the finest ever!” declared Walter.
“Of course they try to make you ‘grind’——”</p>

<p>“Grind what?” inquired Mrs. Richards.</p>

<p>“Oh, grind at your books,” said Walter lightly.
“Some of them are all right, though. There’s young
Samson for example——”</p>

<p>“Is that his real name?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“It is among the fellows. On the catalogue his
name is Richard Lee Thomas, I believe. He was
captain of the football team at college two years
ago. He’s the strongest fellow you ever set eyes
on.”</p>

<p>“What does he teach?” inquired Mrs. Richards.</p>

<p>“He coaches mostly, though he has charge of the
gym work too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Mrs. Richards simply.</p>

<p>“He looks after the teams and the ‘physical welfare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
of the pupils,’ the catalogue says. Then there’s
Kaiser; he has charge of the German and French.
He’s a fine old boy. Soc too is good.”</p>

<p>“Soc?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Short for Socrates,” explained Walter. “He
has the Latin and Greek. His real name is Jones,
but the fellows all call him ‘Soc’ for short. ‘Trig’
has the mathematics. His name, I suppose, is
Ephraim Jeremiah Paine, but the fellows had pity
for him and changed his name to ‘Trig.’ Oh,
they’re all fine old boys. You’ll have the time of
your young life, Dan!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>ENTERING SCHOOL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The summer days passed rapidly and Walter
spent many of them in the company of Dan.
One day while they were fishing on Six Town Pond
the great snake was seen again and after a struggle
was killed, though just why either of the boys
wanted to kill the harmless reptile neither could
have explained. “He had no business to be born
a snake if he wanted to stay here,” Dan said with
cheerful assurance and as if his explanation was
sufficient.</p>

<p>There were days when the fishing was excellent
and other times when the efforts of the boys apparently
were without avail in tempting the pickerel
which hid among the weeds and refused to leave
their shelter.</p>

<p>The return game with the Benson nine provided
another day of interest and Walter greatly enjoyed
the experience. Rodman and Benson both made a
gala day of the occasion, and when Walter rode
with the Rodman nine in the huge band-wagon
which the Rodman Cornet Band kindly lent the defenders
of the local name, he was deeply interested
in the long line of vehicles which followed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
heroes on their way to the rival village, absorbing
dust and loyalty all the way.</p>

<p>The game itself was more or less of a repetition
of the preceding game. Dan’s cunning did not fail
him, and exactly the same number of hitters fell
victims to his curves as had struck out in the former
game. Walter’s father had been in town on the
great day and, at his boy’s eager request, had ridden
in his automobile to the scene of the contest. He
was quizzically warm in his words of praise after
the game, for Walter had played a better game than
in the previous match, but it was his boy’s enthusiasm
over the youthful pitcher’s “great work” that
called forth Mr. Borden’s deeper interest. Upon
his invitation both Walter and Dan rode with him
back to Rodman. Silas, the harness-maker, upon
Mr. Borden’s suggestion also occupied a seat in the
car, and his continued praises caused Mr. Borden
to enjoy his presence.</p>

<p>“I’m tellin’ ye,” roared Silas, “that Dan ought
to have the New Yorks up here for one game anyway.
That boy is a credit to Rodman an’ everybody
what lives here! He can pitch th’ legs off a
brass monkey! I never see such a ball-player.”</p>

<p>“He plays a very good game,” remarked Mr.
Borden smiling pleasantly at Dan as he spoke.
“Aren’t you afraid, Silas, that you’ll spoil him
with your flattering words?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Ye can’t spoil Dan. I hear ye’re
goin’ off t’ school with this Borden boy, Dan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, education’s a great thing. I wish I had
some o’ it.”</p>

<p>“You have,” remarked Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“Who? You mean me? I may be a fool ’bout
some things, but I guess I ain’t such a fool as t’
not know that I don’t know nothin’.”</p>

<p>“One of the wisest men that ever lived once
said that he thought the men who didn’t know and
knew enough to know that they didn’t know were
very wise.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” sniffed Silas, his round freckled face
nevertheless betraying his deep pleasure. “I guess
I c’n make a harness that can stan’ the strain o’ five
ton, but when ye’ve said that ye’ve said th’ whole
thing. Now, here’s Walter. Th’ other day I see in
th’ Rodman ‘Reflector’ some newfangled words.
If I rec’lect aright they was ‘sick transum glory
Monday’——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Sic transit gloria mundi</i>,” interrupted Walter
laughingly.</p>

<p>“That’s jes’ exackly what I said,” declared Silas.
“I didn’t know no more what they mean than ’s if
they been words that Julius Cæsar spoke.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did,” said Walter. “They are Latin
words.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t tell me. Well, Mr. Borden, I couldn’t
make head nor tail t’ ’em. A ‘sick transum’ an’
‘Monday’ was all th’ sense there was. But that
boy o’ yourn he come ’long an’, sir, he read ’em jes’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
’s easy ’s if he was fallin’ off a log. Yes, sir. Now,
ye see, he had th’ education and I had none.”</p>

<p>“What did Walter say the words meant?” inquired
Mr. Borden dryly.</p>

<p>“I disremember, but it was something ’bout
glory.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Walter or Dan could mend a
horse-collar?”</p>

<p>“Dan might; I’m not so sure o’ your boy, that is,
jes’ at th’ present time. Course he could learn.”</p>

<p>“Then he’d be better educated after he had
learned.”</p>

<p>“Sewin’ horse-collars isn’t education!” sniffed
Silas.</p>

<p>“I think it is or may be.”</p>

<p>“How d’ye make that out? I never went t’ school
much. I c’n make out th’ scores in th’ Rodman
‘Reflector’ an’ I c’n chalk up th’ charge for fixin’
Deacon Stillman’s horse-collar, but I never went t’
school none whatever.”</p>

<p>“Going to school does not necessarily mean obtaining
an education.”</p>

<p>“Go on! I guess ye’re tryin’ t’ stuff me.”</p>

<p>“Suppose a boy should go to school and not
learn?”</p>

<p>“His teachers will give him th’ learnin’.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately that is one of the things no
teacher can give—at least he can’t give it unless a
boy takes it.”</p>

<p>“I guess th’ may be somethin’ in that, same’s ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
c’n lead a hoss up t’ th’ water but if he takes a
notion he won’t drink, then th’ whole o’ jumpin’
creation can’t make him swallow a cupful.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. And a boy can be sent to the best
school, but if he won’t learn there’s no education or
power for him. I used to know some of the boys
when I was in school who thought they were getting
the better of their teachers when they cheated in
exams, or dodged a lesson. The foolish fellows!
They didn’t know enough to know that they themselves
were the only ones that were cheated. A
school or college is a place where a boy learns, or
rather can learn if he tries, how to use his brains.
If he doesn’t do the work then he doesn’t learn—at
least he doesn’t learn there.”</p>

<p>Walter was somewhat uncomfortable at the turn
the conversation had taken and interrupting, he said
to Silas, “Don’t you think Dan will make a good
pitcher for the Tait School nine?”</p>

<p>“‘Good?’” retorted Silas instantly diverted.
“‘Good?’ There’s none better. If th’ New Yorks
onct got a chance t’ see him work then ’twould be
good-day for your school. I’m told that some o’
them players get as much as ten dollars a game.
D’ye s’pose that can be true?”</p>

<p>Walter laughed as he said, “Silas, some of them
get four or five times as much as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, Dan’ll get it then.”</p>

<p>“I believe he will do well whatever he tries to
do,” said Mr. Borden quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“Ye’re right he will. I charged Tim Long two
shillin’ for fixin’ his tugs this mornin’ an’ it took
me ’most two hours. If I had Dan’s chance I’d be
makin’ four times that, I guess.”</p>

<p>Dan, who had been the subject of much of the
conversation on the way back to Rodman, seldom
spoke. There was an air of seriousness about the
thoughtful boy that was marked. Mr. Borden occasionally
glanced at him, and there was always a
quiet smile of approval whenever he did so. Whatever
Walter’s hopes and plans for his friend were,
it was manifest that his father also had thoughts of
his own, though he did not once refer to them in
the presence of his boy.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At last the day arrived when Walter was to depart
from Rodman. In two weeks the Tait School
was to reopen and there were many things to be
done in the city before he went.</p>

<p>Before the family left for home, Mrs. Borden was
seated one evening on the piazza alone with her husband
and broached a subject which had long been in
her mind. “Don’t you think it would be a good
thing to take Dan back home with us for a few
days before he enters school? You know he——”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Borden hesitated a moment her husband
said, “You mean to teach him a few things?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just what I mean. You know Dan
has not been accustomed to some things that Walter
has.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I know. What, for example?”</p>

<p>“Well, he hasn’t had any training, at least such
as Walter has had, in his table manners. Of course
his mother is a good woman, but——”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t use his knife and fork properly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, though that’s only one thing.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“He needs some clothes.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with those he wears?”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“They aren’t cut like Walter’s?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. If I do say it, Walter always wears
his clothes well.”</p>

<p>“They ought to wear well. They cost me enough.
His bill at the tailor’s this spring——”</p>

<p>“I am not talking about the quality of his clothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do. You’re a little afraid that when
Dan finds himself among a lot of boys who have
been brought up in wealthy homes and who have
doting mothers and perhaps very foolish fathers
that he will mortify Walter by some of the things
he does. I think I understand you.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of Dan just as much or more than
I am of Walter,” protested Mrs. Borden. “He will
be mortified by some things he’ll do for which he is
not at all to blame.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault will it be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Why—I should say not of anyone exactly. It
is just that he’ll have to meet new conditions, that’s
all. I am sure I haven’t any foolish pride. I don’t
want Dan to suffer too much just because he doesn’t
understand some things.”</p>

<p>“How much do you want him to suffer? You
say you don’t want him to suffer too much. Where
do you draw the line?”</p>

<p>“I can quietly save him a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can.”</p>

<p>“Do you agree to his going home with us?”</p>

<p>“Personally I like Dan. I should be glad to have
him come home with us and I am sure he would
pick up and use a good many of the very useful
lessons you would teach him in your own quiet way.
But I’m afraid it can’t be done just now. We can
arrange for him to come in some vacation.”</p>

<p>“That will be too late I’m afraid. Why can’t he
come now?”</p>

<p>“The work on the farm for one thing. He will
want to do all he can to help Tom with the fall
work before he leaves.”</p>

<p>“You might hire a helper for Tom.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I might, but for Dan’s sake I don’t want
to. Dan must not think he is to do any less for
his brother. Then too, Dan will not be slow in
finding out what he ought to do in the school. He
has eyes as well as brains. He has something better
than either eyes or brains too.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“Character. He won’t say ‘no’ and then wobble.
He knows just what the two little Saxon words
‘yes’ and ‘no’ mean. I wish Walter did too, and
it is the hope that Dan will help teach him that more
than anything else that is making me send him to
the Tait School. I’m glad to have him room with
Walter.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he is a brighter boy than Walter,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but he has learned some things that Walter
doesn’t know, and if he doesn’t learn them soon he
never will. No, mother, I honestly believe it will
be better for Walter to let Dan go straight to the
school. If he meets the new conditions, as I believe
he will, the effect on our boy will be all the
better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see; but if you think it is better for
Walter, then I’m sure I’ll not say another word. I
was thinking it would be a little easier perhaps for
both of them if I had Dan home with me a few
days.”</p>

<p>“It would be easier, but perhaps not better.”</p>

<p>Two weeks later Dan arrived at the Tait School.
Walter already had been on the ground two days,
and when his friend at last was directed to the room
he was to occupy, he came with a heavy canvas bag
in his hand and found himself face to face with
Walter and another boy, who was introduced to
him as Sin Bradley.</p>

<small>NEW ACQUAINTANCES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Hello—o—o, Dan!” Walter had exclaimed
as he first caught sight of his friend in the
doorway. “Come right in! I’m mighty glad to see
you!” The impulsive Walter had leaped from the
chair in which he was seated and darting to the door
seized Dan by the hand, then grasped his canvas bag
which he hurriedly took into the little bedroom
which Dan was to occupy. Turning quickly about
he said to Sinclair: “Sin, this is the new fellow I
was telling you about. Stand up and do yourself
proud to shake hands with Dan Richards. He’s
going to be the new pitcher on the Tait School nine
and he’ll make our opponents work some!”</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” said Sin drawlingly, as
he shook hands with the new boy. The contrast
between the two for the first time struck Walter
almost with the force of a blow: one easy and self-possessed
in his manner, dressed in the latest
fashion, and having the confidence that is the result
of the possession of wealth and all that money implies;
the other quiet, but still somewhat self-conscious.
His clothing manifestly was not made by a
fashionable tailor, and his face and hands showed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the effect of his toil in the fields. For a moment
Walter almost felt as if Dan must be painfully aware
of his own deficiencies. But if the newcomer
was abashed in the presence of Sinclair Bradley,
his manner at least failed to betray it.</p>

<p>“I was late,” said Dan simply as he responded
to Sin’s greeting, and then in response to Walter’s
suggestion seated himself in one of the large easy
chairs in the room. “I guess I’m not very much
of a traveler, for I stood still in the depot at Lee
Junction and let my train pull out and leave me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll learn,” laughed Walter a trifle noisily.
“How long did you have to wait?”</p>

<p>“Two hours.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. You’ll know better next time.”</p>

<p>“How did you leave all the old folks at home?”
asked Sin with a drawl.</p>

<p>“They were well when I left,” replied Dan
quietly.</p>

<p>“Good. How is Silas?”</p>

<p>“Silas who?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the particular individual. Just
Silas, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Silas, the harness-maker, is in good health.”</p>

<p>“How are the crops?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair.”</p>

<p>“Do you raise much hay?”</p>

<p>“Not a great deal.”</p>

<p>“What do you do with the hay-seed?”</p>

<p>“We don’t raise any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Is that so? I fancied you did. Don’t all
farmers raise hay-seed?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Dan quietly, looking calmly at Sin
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I confess my ignorance. You must forgive
me.”</p>

<p>Dan glanced at Walter as if he was somehow
puzzled, but his dark eyes and bronzed face did not
change their expression. “If you don’t get into the
country very often of course you have forgotten
some things,” he said to Sinclair. “I remember
only last summer there was a family that came to
Rodman to spend a few days. I didn’t know them,
but it seems their father was raised in our town; he
went down to the city and made a lot of money.
This man Silas you asked me about knew them all,
though, and he explained everything to them, told
them how he had helped take their grandfather to
the town poorhouse and got up a donation party
for the children. He described the first mule their
father bought—for it seems he made his first money
as a horse-trader before he began to buy hogs.”</p>

<p>“No wonder they forgot,” said Sinclair a little
foolishly as he arose. “So long, Walter,” he added
lightly. “I’ll see you again,” he said to Dan and
at once departed from the room.</p>

<p>“You were enough for him, Dan,” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“‘Enough for him’? I don’t know that I understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, you do.”</p>

<p>“Walter, what does this fellow Sinclair’s father
do for a living?”</p>

<p>“I understand that he is a brewer,” replied
Walter a trifle uneasily.</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p>“So I hear. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing in particular. How shall I get my
trunk up here? Can I borrow a wheelbarrow somewhere
about the school?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“The expressman will bring it up for you. Didn’t
you give your trunk check to the man at the station?”</p>

<p>“What man? There were a good many men
there.”</p>

<p>“The expressman.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any. I can bring it up myself.”</p>

<p>“Let me have your check,” said Walter harshly.
Dan handed his roommate his baggage check and as
he did so two boys noisily entered the room and
greeted Walter with a shout. “Hello, old man!”
exclaimed one of them as he seized Walter’s hand
and shook it. The other followed his companion’s
example, Dan meanwhile quietly observing the two
boys and feeling drawn at once to the one who had
first greeted his roommate. Even before he was introduced
Dan became aware that the boy was
known as “Priz,” though what the name implied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
he did not know. The boy was a sturdy fellow,
manifestly possessed of great physical strength, and
his actions were so quick that they were almost
catlike. The other boy was tall and slender and
much more refined in his bearing. His name, or at
least his nickname, Dan learned was “Chesty,”
though why such a slender delicate fellow should
receive such a cognomen he could not at the time
conjecture.</p>

<p>“This is my new roommate,” said Walter after
a brief delay, as he presented Dan. “‘Priz’ is the
name that Ned Davis goes by,” he explained with a
laugh. “You want to keep on good terms with
him.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I want to,” said Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“He’s the best boxer in the Tait School,” Walter
explained. “‘Priz’ is short for prize—prize-fighter,
if you want the whole thing. We call him that for
short. Priz,” he added, “I guess you’ll have more
to do with Dan than any of the rest of us. Dan’s
the fellow I wrote you about this summer—striking
out fifteen men, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, I’m one of the catchers of
the nine here and I guess you and I will come to
see a good deal of each other. I hope so, anyway.
I’m mighty glad you came here. It’s the best school
in the country.”</p>

<p>Dan quietly acknowledged the cordial greeting
and at once felt that he would like Ned Davis, for
the boy was genuinely cordial and his interest in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the possibility of a new “find” for the pitcher’s box
was genuine.</p>

<p>“Chesty is short for Lord Chesterfield,” Walter
continued as he laughingly turned to the other newcomer.
“In the catalogue his name appears as
Frank Harwood Hoblit, Jr., but that’s too much of a
mouthful, so we cut it short to ‘Chesty.’ If you
ever want to know what color your necktie ought
to be to match your socks, or what the proper attitude
is when you are addressing the President of
the United States, why Chesty is the boy to give
you points. He is up on all the fine points of
etiquette. He is little Lord Chesterfield, just called
‘Chesty’ for short.”</p>

<p>“We’re not quite so bad as Walter makes us
out,” laughed Ned. “I never was in a fight in my
life——”</p>

<p>“All the same you want to be good to him,”
broke in Walter. “He’s the kind of a chap you let
have the whole sidewalk and never say a word to if
you happen to meet him some dark night.”</p>

<p>“He’s never out at night,” said Frank. “You
never saw such a fellow to sleep. He’s usually in
bed before the warning bell rings. I’ve thought
sometimes I might just as well be rooming with a
mummy as with him.”</p>

<p>“I have had the same feeling,” retorted Ned,
“only I spelled my ‘mummy’ with a ‘d.’”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky to be able to spell it any way,”
declared Frank. “He wrote me this summer, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
what do you think? He had the nerve to spell my
middle name Hardwood.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of Soc’s efforts in your behalf,”
laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Are all the fellows back?” he added turning to
Walter. “Chesty and I just came in and we made
a bee-line for your room. Seems like away back in
the Dark Ages since we parted. What have you
been doing all summer?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been up at Rodman most of the time, on my
grandfather’s farm,” replied Walter.</p>

<p>“Buried alive?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; not buried alive. Dan and I fished and
played ball—that’s how I made my find. Dan is
the best pitcher for a fellow of his age I ever saw.
Moulton has been training him all summer——”</p>

<p>“What Moulton?” interrupted Ned quickly.</p>

<p>“Moulton of Princeton,” said Walter, trying to
speak unconcernedly. “He says Dan is the most
promising young pitcher he has found.”</p>

<p>Plainly impressed by what Walter said, Ned
looked at Dan with renewed interest. He noted
the long arm, the wiry form, the evident power and
endurance, and his enthusiasm at once was aroused.
“I’m glad you’re here, Dan,” he said simply. “Of
course there isn’t much baseball in the fall—everything
goes to football then. But we have some
interform games; they’re mostly to keep up the
spirit of the thing and try out the new fellows.
We’ll give you a chance to show your mettle——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“I’m wondering if I shall have any time for
baseball,” said Dan simply. “I’ll probably have
to work so hard at my books to keep up with
you——”</p>

<p>“You won’t have to work very hard to keep up
with Chesty,” broke in Ned with a laugh. “It’s
nip and tuck between him and Walter here, and
me, to see who’ll lead the class if you turn it wrong
end to. And yet I’m improving some,” declared
Ned. “I was down on the shore of Long Island
this summer and took to riding a wheel. One day
I was coasting down a small hill and coming at a
pretty good clip, when my wheel struck a pocket of
sand and I took a header before I could say Jack
Robinson. A gentle, antique, old farmer and his boy
happened to be passing in a farm-wagon at the
time, and they both got off to see if I was hurt.
‘Hurt ye much?’ the old man asked me. When I
told him I was all right he wanted to know how
it happened, and with my exam in physics fresh in
my mind I told him. I said, ‘When I came down
that incline and my front cylindrical means of propulsion
struck that pocket of disintegrated igneous
rock my velocity was such that I lost my center of
gravity and was precipitated upon the hard road of
asphalt.’”</p>

<p>“What did the old boy say?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“‘Say’! For a moment that ancient and antiquated
tiller of the soil was speechless. He hadn’t
expected to hear such nice words as I gave him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Finally the old chap turned to his boy and gently
remarked, ‘Come on, bub, I guess th’ fellow is one
o’ them tarnal foreign chaps what can’t talk United
States.’”</p>

<p>“You ought not to excoriate the venerable husbandman
after your providential escape,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“Now, I wasn’t excoriating him. I’m no cannibal!”
declared Ned.</p>

<p>“What has a cannibal to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know what a cannibal is?”</p>

<p>“I sure do. He is a chap that devours another.”</p>

<p>“Course he is. Well, if a fellow bites another
fellow’s back—a sort of backbiter, so to speak—I’d
like to know if he doesn’t at least belong to
the cannibal tribe, though I confess I don’t know
whether they begin their shocking repast at the
back or not.”</p>

<p>“You are brilliant to-day, Ned,” laughed Walter.
“How do you account for it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t account for it. Maybe I sharpened my
wits up a bit this summer with all my ‘wading.’”</p>

<p>“Wading?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said, didn’t I? Wading! W-a-d-ing!
No, hold on, that isn’t the way to spell it.
W-a-d-d-ing! That’s right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Depends on whether you mean wading or wadding.”</p>

<p>“I mean wading, all right. I waded all summer
long——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Get wet?”</p>

<p>“Not a drop.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“I was wading with the accompaniment of a
tutor through some of the dryest books a man ever
tackled.”</p>

<p>“You’re the same old Ned,” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s the worst of it,” said Ned
somewhat ruefully. “Dan,” he added abruptly,
turning to the new boy, “when will you come down
to the diamond and give your mighty right arm
a chance to show what it can do?”</p>

<small>WALTER’S SUGGESTIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“I’ll come any time you say,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Ned cheerily. “We’ll fix
it up in a day or two. We ought to start right in
on our inter-form games and find out what material
we can count on for the spring.”</p>

<p>Several other boys dropped in and the two visitors
departed. There were continued greetings
among the noisy, light-hearted boys, and in spite
of the fact that the work of the new year was about
to begin it was manifest that most of them were
glad to be back in school once more.</p>

<p>To Dan the entire scene was so filled with novelty
that he was an interested spectator, taking but little
part in the conversations that occurred whenever the
boys came to his room or hailed one another on
the campus. In the dining-hall, which was in a
large central building to which all the boys and
many of the teachers came for their meals, his interest
became still more marked, for here for the
first time he saw the boys who were to be his leaders
in his new life. It was dusk when the boys filed out
of the dining-hall, and Dan dropped behind his
roommate to walk with Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad you came with Walter,” Ned was saying.
“We’re in great need of a new pitcher. ‘Red’
Chandler finished his work here this spring and
has gone up to Harvard. He’ll make the college
nine first thing, you see if he doesn’t. He’s a born
ball-player and he had the finest assortment of
curves that the Tait School ever saw. He pitched
a one-hit game against the Yale freshman team in
June. Never made a hit, never got a ball outside
the diamond until the ninth inning, and that was a
scratch. The third-baseman of the freshman team
let the ball hit his bat. I don’t believe he ever
struck at it at all. If you can come anywhere near
‘Red’ you can own the whole school.”</p>

<p>Dan listened as Ned rattled on in his noisy boyish
way, but he seldom replied except to certain direct
questions.</p>

<p>“Can you pitch a drop?” Ned asked.</p>

<p>“Moulton said I could.”</p>

<p>“Good. He ought to know. Red had a ‘jump’
that was simply fierce. We always saved it for the
third strike. And the beauty of it all was that I
did not have to signal for it, so the other fellows
never caught on. No signal just meant the ‘jump.’
You see, I had caught Red two years and we became
almost like a machine.”</p>

<p>“The boys”—Dan started to say fellows but corrected
himself—“must be sorry to lose him.”</p>

<p>“They are. Last summer when we shut up shop
we all felt as if we had lost our best friend when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Red left us. He certainly was a wonder! But if
you can measure up to him or come anywhere near,
you’ll wear diamonds here till you graduate—and
forever after, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“And if I don’t?”</p>

<p>“Why—you’ll be all right. Sometimes you know
a fellow gets a name for doing wonders in the place
he comes from, but he finds out after he has been
here a spell that—well, that the conditions aren’t
just exactly the same. See, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“It’s just this way—you’ve got nothing to lose
and everything to gain. If you can make good——”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Walter has talked me up more than I
deserve,” broke in Dan. “He’s a good friend——”</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?”</p>

<p>“Ever since we were little fellows. He has been
spending his summers on his grandfather’s farm,
and our farm was close by, so Walter and I naturally
were together a good deal. This summer he
hired me to take him fishing.”</p>

<p>Ned’s keen glance of surprise was not lost upon
his companion, but as he did not speak Dan too became
silent as the two boys followed Walter and
Chesty, who were not far in advance. In the silence
suddenly the words of the latter to Walter became
plain to Dan and Ned. “Where did you pick up
your bucolic?” Chesty was saying.</p>

<p>“Picked him up in the hayfield,” Walter laughingly
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“His hair is full of hayseed.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. If that is the sort of thing you
like, then you like just the sort of thing you’ve got,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“He can pitch like a fiend.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“He’ll own the whole school pretty soon if he can
measure up to Red Chandler!”</p>

<p>“Red Chandler!” retorted Chesty scornfully.
“He was just another such fellow as your friend
from the hayfield. He didn’t know how to act like
a gentleman. He was just a great, rough——”</p>

<p>“He’s the best pitcher the Tait School nine ever
had!”</p>

<p>“What of that? He used to say, ‘I done it.’ He
never had a suit of clothes that fitted him. He was
not and never could be a gentleman.”</p>

<p>It was too dark to permit Ned to see Dan’s
face and yet he was aware that his companion must
have heard Chesty’s words. Impulsively he turned
to Dan and said, “Don’t pay any attention to what
that Chesty has been saying. He doesn’t know anything
except what a tailor can tell him. He doesn’t
know what he is here for. He thinks his money can
buy anything. You don’t mind his chaff, do you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had much time to find out yet,” replied
Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you mind it! I’ll tell Chesty what I
think of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“No, don’t say a word. Don’t let him know that
we heard what he said. I don’t want Walter to
know.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say,” said Ned lightly. “If I can arrange
with Samson I’ll get the fellows out for a little
baseball to-morrow. You aren’t going in for football
are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect to.”</p>

<p>“Good! Of course football is all the rage in the
fall. It’s a good enough game, but give me baseball
every time.”</p>

<p>“I never saw a game of football.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” laughed Ned lightly. “Where
have you lived all these days?” Then as Dan did
not reply he hastily added, as he recalled the sneering
words of Chesty, “There’ll be time enough for
all that. I just don’t want you to get switched off
into football, that’s all. Of course we’ll have to
wait till spring before we do much on the diamond.
Football somehow has got the right of way in the
fall, but we do a little trying out now, and that’s
about all we can expect. I’ll let you know to-morrow
about the practice. Now don’t fail to show up.
And just forget all about Chesty and his cheap
talk.”</p>

<p>Dan did not respond, but turned with Walter and
went up the stairway to their room on the second
floor. He did not betray by his manner that he had
overheard the words of Chesty to Walter, and as
the latter suggested that they should at once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
arrange their belongings in their rooms he quietly
agreed. Dan’s trunk, a somewhat crude and manifestly
antique affair, had been left outside the door
and when Walter said, “Here, Dan, I’ll give you a
lift,” and at once took hold of one end of the trunk,
Dan somehow felt that his roommate was more
eager to get the trunk into a bedroom where it
could not be seen than he was to help. Dan, without
a word, helped carry the heavy trunk to the bedroom
which had been assigned him and as soon as
Walter started to unpack his own trunk he too
began.</p>

<p>There were three rooms in the suite, a bedroom
for each boy and a sitting-room or study which both
were to use. In spite of the simplicity and plainness
of the furnishings—a condition duly emphasized
by the school catalogue—Dan’s feeling was
that he was surrounded by luxury. Certainly everything
was unlike the plainness of his own little
home on the farm near Rodman. The thought increased
Dan’s feeling of depression. He had a
vision of his brother Tom, who by this time had
ended his chores and doubtless was sitting with his
mother on the piazza, talking with her over their
loneliness. He fancied he almost could hear his
mother in her calm way, which was deceptive to
many by its very calmness, say to Tom that she was
glad Dan had such a good opportunity to secure
an education. He wondered what she would say
if she knew his own feelings at the moment. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
sneering remarks of Chesty had cut deep. Up to this
time Dan had not been aware that his manners or
dress were very different from those of others.</p>

<p>Now that he had, for the first time in his life, been
thrown into the midst of a crowd of boys of his
own age, all of whom possessed, or at least seemed
to possess, an indefinable something which he was
aware was lacking in his own person, he felt
strongly that something was wrong. Ned had been
cordial, but his keen interest in the possibility of the
nine securing a good pitcher doubtless accounted
for that. Chesty had spoken frankly and without
a suspicion that his words had been overheard.
And Dan, in his quiet way, was suffering. His life
had not been like that of the boys in the Tait School.
He almost wished that he had not yielded to
Mr. Borden’s persuasive words. At the normal
school there were many who came from homes like
his own. Several boys from Rodman had worked
their way through that school. They had been
waiters in the dining-room or cared for the grounds,
served as aids to the janitor or had done various
other humble duties by which they helped themselves.</p>

<p>Dan’s thoughts were busied with these things
while he unpacked, until at last his trunk was empty
and its contents bestowed where they belonged.
One of the last things he had found in the trunk
was a study gown upon which his mother had
labored evenings after the tasks of the day were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
done. The sight of it recalled her love and devotion
so vividly that Dan threw aside his coat and
donned the long odd garment before he responded
to Walter’s call and came into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Got everything done, Dan?” said Walter
cheerily. “Can I help you any? For the love of
country, Dan,” Walter abruptly added as for the
first time he noticed his roommate’s gown, “where
on earth did you find that thing? What is it? Did
you use it to milk in?”</p>

<p>“It’s a study gown,” replied Dan, blushing
slightly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t study in it, Dan. If the fellows
should see it they’d never stop guying you. It looks
like a relic of the Stone age. Here, help me tack
up this skin. Isn’t it a beauty?” Walter held up
to view the skin of the huge snake which he and
Dan had secured on Six Town Pond and Walter
had had prepared by Silas the harness-maker.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a beauty!” he again exclaimed enthusiastically
when the skin had been tacked to the
wall. “That’ll make the fellows stand up and open
their eyes. I wonder what Chesty will say when he
sees it? By the way, Dan, do you want me to give
you a pointer?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Why—well—you see the ways of the fellows
here are not just exactly as they are in Rodman,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you want to put your butter on the butter-plate
and not on the rim of your serving-plate.
You don’t mind my speaking of it, do you? You’ll
pick these things up in a jiffy, but I thought—I
didn’t know—but you’d like to have me tell you
when I happened to see some little thing that is
not just like—that’s a little different——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Walter. I know I’m not used
to some things that you and Chesty——”</p>

<p>“Never mind Chesty,” broke in Walter a little
uneasily as Dan believed. “There are quantities of
points you can give me—a good many more than I
can give you. They’re only little pointers. I say,
Dan, I’ve been talking you up with a lot of the
fellows. They are expecting you to do something
big to-morrow if we have the fellows out for practice
then. You won’t go back on me, will you,
Dan?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you have talked too much.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” declared Walter confidently. “You
can do it! Just think you’ve got some of those
Benson fellows facing you! I tell you what, Dan!
If you make good the fellows will all be so glad
that I made my ‘find’ this summer that they’ll
make me captain of the nine next year.”</p>

<small>A SCRUB GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The following day proved to be rainy and the
“trying out” of the prospective ball-players
was consequently impossible. The day was filled,
however, with novelty to Dan, who was assigned
to the same class or form to which Walter belonged.
This was as Mr. Borden had hoped and it may
have been that a letter from him to the head
master may have had something to do with his
grading.</p>

<p>In the Tait School there were seven buildings.
Four of these were dormitories; two were superb
buildings arranged for classroom work and containing
a great hall in which at eleven o’clock every
morning the students assembled for chapel; the
remaining building was the refectory or dining-hall.
Beyond the buildings was the great athletic
field. The football and baseball fields were surrounded
by a cinder track. Tennis-courts were
numerous and the entire plant had been deeply impressive
to Dan when Walter first had led him to
the field. The sight of the covered grand stand and
of the tiers of “bleachers” that extended along
either side of the field also had moved the new boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
strongly. The sight had suggested the scene which
a game would present. Dan thought he could see
the excited spectators and even hear their shouts of
approval. Was it possible that he could be the
pitcher—the central figure in the nine toward which
the eyes of all would be turned? For the first
time the country boy had a feeling of depression.
He had never been put to the test of facing experienced
batters. It was true he had been phenomenally
successful against the Benson and other local
nines. But they were as inexperienced as he.
Then he recalled the quiet and confident words of
Moulton. “If you keep on, Dan, you are going
to be one of the best college pitchers. I shall follow
you for a year or two and keep watch of your work.
If you do what I believe you will, we’ll be sure to
fix your college course all right.”</p>

<p>Dan had not fully understood just what Moulton
meant, but as he recalled his words now they were
wonderfully comforting. He would do his best to
show Moulton that all his aid had not been wasted.</p>

<p>“You’re a new boy too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Dan, who was walking across the campus on his
way to his room, looked up as he heard the question
and saw before him a slight delicate boy, apparently
about fourteen years of age, though he was smaller
than most boys of that age.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m a new boy,” replied Dan smiling as he
spoke and stopping to wait for the lad to join him.
“Are you new too?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“Yes. I just came last night. It’s the first time
I have ever been away from home.” The lad’s
eyes were moist and Dan’s sympathy was at once
aroused. He understood the feelings of his companion,
though he had different ways of expression.</p>

<p>“First time I’ve ever been away from home too,”
he said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Is it?” inquired the lad, interested at once.
“Which form are you in?”</p>

<p>“Second.”</p>

<p>“I’m only in the fourth. You’ll have only two
years here.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll have four.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the boy responded, as if the prospect was
far from pleasing. “My name is Carlton Hall.
What is yours?”</p>

<p>“Dan Richards. Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Brooklyn.”</p>

<p>“I live away up in the country. I never expected
to have a chance to come to this school——”</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” interrupted the boy.</p>

<p>“It must be a wonderful place,” replied Dan
quietly. “You and I will both have to keep before
us all the time what it means to be students in the
Tait School.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Carlton feebly. “Do you know
I am glad I have to study with the teachers. I’d get
lonesome if I didn’t. You see, I room alone——”</p>

<p>“Study with the teachers?” broke in Dan.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t you know? Why the first-form boys
are allowed to do all their work in their rooms,
unless they get too low a standing in their exams.
Then the fellows in the second form who stand in
the first division are allowed to study in their
rooms too. All the rest have to study every afternoon
and evening in one of the study rooms.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it is. Won’t you come over
and see me pretty soon?” inquired Carlton wistfully.</p>

<p>“Where do you room?”</p>

<p>“In Boyd Hall, number seven. It’s the single
room at the head of the stairs, in the south entry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to come,” Dan promised readily.
The unspoken appeal in the big blue eyes could not
be resisted. “Come over and make a call on me.
I’m in nine, Badger Hall—west entry.”</p>

<p>“Do you room alone?”</p>

<p>“No, Walter Borden rooms with me.”</p>

<p>When Dan entered his room he found Walter
and Ned both there, and as soon as they saw him
Walter exclaimed, “What do you think, Dan?
We’ve got a proposition to form a school league.”</p>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>“You’re right we have. I don’t understand why
it hasn’t been done long ago. Four schools, St.
John’s, the Greystone Military School, the Atlas
High School, and the Military Academy at Dundee.
Of course, we’ll find some muckers in the high-school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
nine, but they can play ball. It’ll be a great
scheme. Whichever wins the championship of the
league has got the State interscholastic championship
too, for there isn’t another school in the State
that can touch any one of the four. It’s too late
to take in football, but we’ll have that next fall. It
will bring us right into line for the baseball and
track and tennis in the spring. Perhaps we can fix
things up in time for hockey and basket-ball this
winter——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Walter,” interrupted Dan. “You go
too fast for me. I guess I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, you see it’s this way,” explained Ned.
“These four schools are near one another and they
put up the best article in the way of athletics in
the State. We have games every year anyway, but
by this new arrangement we have a league, you see.
There’ll be regularly scheduled games and the nine
or the team that wins out will get a pennant. It
will be able to claim too, the championship of the
State. It’s a great scheme and there’s only one
drawback; I don’t mean a drawback exactly, I
mean there’s only one question——”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Walter.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the question of Dan. If he can make
good as the pitcher of the Tait School nine it will
be all right——”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to go into the league unless you
can get that pennant? Is that it?” asked Dan
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>“I’d rather go in if we can win,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Somebody will have to come out last,” suggested
Walter.</p>

<p>“‘Strange but true,’” laughed Ned. “I am
aware of that marvelous fact, but after Red’s work
last year—why, Dan, the Military Academy got only
one hit and that was on account of an accident in
the ninth inning——”</p>

<p>“So you’ve told us a million times or more,”
broke in Walter irritably. “Don’t tell us that old
story again. I’ll back Dan. He’ll give you all
you want.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, for the sake of the nine, I hope he
will,” said Ned good-naturedly. “That’s all I
want.”</p>

<p>“He’ll do it,” said Walter confidently.</p>

<p>“I’ve been talking with Samson,” said Ned, “and
he says we can begin the inter-form games next
week. The first game will be between the first and
second forms, fellows. I’ll tell you, Dan, that Gus
Kiggins—he’s the first-form pitcher—will put you
on your mettle. He’s been substitute pitcher on
the school nine two years, and he’s sore because
Red Chandler came in last year and won out as the
regular pitcher. He doesn’t know that you are here
or that you can pitch——”</p>

<p>“He will at the end of the first inning,” declared
Walter.</p>

<p>“I hope so, with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Dan in a low voice, “you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
aren’t going to put me in as the pitcher of the
second-form nine, are you?”</p>

<p>“Correct,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t tried me. You don’t know
whether I can do it or not. I don’t know myself——”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Walter.</p>

<p>Dan shook his head as he said quietly, “Walter
is not the best judge.”</p>

<p>“I’m captain of the second-form nine,” said Ned.
“I’ll give you a chance to make good. If you
don’t——”</p>

<p>“What then?” inquired Dan.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ll retire in favor of your successor,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You must see what my work is first,” said Dan
firmly.</p>

<p>“Just what I intend to do. It’ll be clear to-morrow
and we will get up a scrub game on the
campus at two-thirty. We’ll have the diamond all
to ourselves, for most of the fellows will want to
see what the prospects for the eleven are. They’ll
be down watching the football practice and we’ll
have the field to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“How about Gus Kiggins? Will he come out?”
inquired Walter.</p>

<p>“No. He’s out for half-back on the eleven this
fall. I guess he’ll make it too,” replied Ned. “All
the better if he doesn’t show up.”</p>

<p>“He’ll pitch for the first form, won’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“You can rest easy about that,” laughed Ned.
“Gus will be on deck then. He loves the spotlight.”</p>

<p>“He is all right too,” said Walter.</p>

<p>“Yes, he can play ball. He’ll be the pitcher of
the school nine, unless Dan goes him one better.”</p>

<p>“Dan will do it all right,” asserted Walter, although
even Dan somehow felt there was a slight
note of anxiety in his roommate’s apparent confidence.</p>

<p>Promptly at half past two the following afternoon
Dan and Walter went to the field. Ned had had
his difficulties in securing sufficient players to make
up two nines, so keen was the interest of the school
in learning what the outlook for the eleven was
likely to be. However, after a time, two nines were
obtained and preparations for the scrub game were
completed.</p>

<p>“Dan, you can’t pitch in those clothes!” protested
Walter as his roommate seated himself on
the bench. “Where’s your uniform?”</p>

<p>“What uniform?”</p>

<p>“Why, the one you used in Rodman.”</p>

<p>“I left that with that study gown you didn’t
like.”</p>

<p>Walter’s face flushed slightly as he said: “But
Dan, you don’t understand how much depends on
the impression you make on Ned and the other fellows
to-day. Let me get you——”</p>

<p>Walter rose abruptly to go to the dressing-room
of the club-house, but as he did so Dan said quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
“No frills to-day, Walter. This is only a scrub
game anyway.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, at least as far as you are concerned!”</p>

<p>“I’m going into the game just as I am,” said Dan
in a low voice. “I notice that some of the boys
are not wearing uniforms.”</p>

<p>“They don’t need to. They can’t play ball.
But it’s different with you, Dan. I’ve been backing
you up——”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Walter. If I don’t show any signs
of greatness it will be all right, however it comes
out. If I don’t show that I can do anything I’ll feel
better——”</p>

<p>“All right. Have it your own way,” retorted
Walter sulkily. “I can’t do anything more. You’d
do better if you had the shoes——”</p>

<p>It was Walter’s turn at the bat and as his
name was called he turned abruptly to the home
plate.</p>

<p>“You’re next,” said Ned to Dan, as Walter made
a hit and gained his base. “Can you bunt? If you
can, let me see you sacrifice Walter to second.”</p>

<p>Dan’s “sacrifice hit,” however, consisted in a long
high fly to deep center. The fielder, evidently an inexperienced
player, misjudged the ball and Walter
ran home, while Dan rested on third base.</p>

<p>“You ought to have done what I told you,” said
Ned sharply when Dan came home a little later.
“You would have been out if there had been a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
fielder in center and the chances are you’d have
doubled up Walter too.”</p>

<p>“I took the chance,” said Dan quietly. “I knew
the fellow couldn’t field.”</p>

<p>“Well, watch my signals now,” said Ned tartly,
as the side was out and he and Dan started for their
position in the field.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br>
<small>A TRY-OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was so early in the school year that opportunities
for talking over the new boys had of necessity
been limited. The fact that Walter had a new
roommate who was somewhat “green” had been
noticed and smilingly commented upon, but what he
was able to do in the school life was unknown. Indeed,
with the exception of two or three of Walter’s
closest friends, to whom he had enthusiastically
described Dan’s success as a pitcher, the matter had
not been referred to.</p>

<p>As the football team claimed the chief interest of
the school at this time there were only a few besides
the two scrub nines present when the game began,
a fact for which Dan was deeply thankful.</p>

<p>“Your agricultural friend is as strong as an ox
and he has a good swing with his bat, but he hasn’t
any more idea of team work than he has of trout-fishing
in Mars,” Ned in a low voice had said
to Walter as the latter passed him to take his
position as short-stop. “We’ll see now what he
can do.”</p>

<p>“Yes; you keep your eyes open,” retorted Walter
confidently. Dan caught the ball which Walter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
threw him and then in turn began to throw it about
the diamond. He had not had an opportunity to
warm up and several weeks had elapsed since he
had had a ball in his hand. To most of the players,
the game was only a “scrub” anyway, but to Dan,
as no one realized more fully than he, there were
larger issues at stake. His quiet manner, however,
was unchanged and only Walter was aware how
eager his friend was to do well.</p>

<p>The opposing batter now advanced to the plate
and Dan caught the ball, settled back in the pitcher’s
box, swung his arm once or twice, and then pitched
the ball. His action was not graceful and the ball
was not swift.</p>

<p>The batter struck at it, but failed to hit it, although
the failure apparently was due to his own
weakness. A straight swift ball produced a second
strike, and then in accordance with the signals and
plan of action to which Ned and Dan had agreed
before they assumed their positions in the field, the
pitcher sent in his “pet,” a form of delivery to
which Moulton had devoted much time and pains.</p>

<p>The ball sped swiftly as it left Dan’s hands and
though it came fairly over the plate the batter
stepped back as if in fear of being hit.</p>

<p>“Here, you timid creature, why don’t you strike
at a good ball when you get it?” demanded Ned
sharply of the batter.</p>

<p>“It didn’t come within a mile of the plate,” retorted
the batter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Come here, Chesty!” called Ned, turning to the
spectators. “Come on and umpire this game. This
fellow can’t tell whether the ball is going to hit him
or whether it started in the other direction.”</p>

<p>“Yea, I’ll do that,” responded “Lord Chesterfield”
as he arose, carefully brushed his clothes with
his hands, and took the position to which he had
been called.</p>

<p>“Two strikes on this fellow,” said Ned as he
replaced his mask and gave his chest-protector a pull.
“Now go ahead. Call it two balls. I don’t know
just how many he deserves.” Signaling to Dan to
repeat his last effort Ned stretched forth his hands
for his pitcher to begin again.</p>

<p>Once more Dan sent in a swift inshoot, that as it
came to the plate suddenly appeared to turn and
vindictively try to hit the player at the bat.</p>

<p>“Three balls,” called Chesty glibly.</p>

<p>Ned glared at him as in duty bound, but did not
speak as he returned the ball to Dan.</p>

<p>“Four balls! Take your base!” shouted Chesty
once more, after Dan had pitched another ball.</p>

<p>Ned started to protest, but a low laugh from
Dan caused him to check the word he was about to
speak and he returned the ball.</p>

<p>The second boy to bat obtained the same result as
his predecessor, and two were on bases.</p>

<p>“Careful, Dan,” called Walter in a low voice
from his position as short-stop. “Take it easy.
Don’t try too hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>Dan did not reply, but swinging about he threw
the ball swiftly to second base and the runner was
caught at least two feet away.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it!” called Ned. “Now
look sharp and we’ll have this fellow on strikes,”
he added as the third boy advanced to the plate.</p>

<p>Dan responded with a ball so swift and unexpected
that Ned dropped it.</p>

<p>“Ball!” shouted Chesty. And as Dan sent in
three more that came with equal speed, he declared
that each was a ball and allowed the batter to take
his base.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Dan?” called Walter.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” responded Dan.</p>

<p>“Get them over the plate.”</p>

<p>“They are,” said Dan quietly. “Your umpire
can’t see straight.” However, Dan apparently did
not try to pitch his best. He retired the side after
one run had been made and twice the ball had been
hit into the infield.</p>

<p>“No use,” he explained to Walter as they walked
in together. “The fellow either can’t or won’t see.
I’ll just give them easy ones and let them go.”</p>

<p>“No; don’t do that. Chesty will see after a bit,”
protested Walter. But Dan was perverse and for
several innings pitched a slower ball which occasionally
was hit, though most of the boys that faced
him struck out.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ned to Walter, after an
hour had elapsed. “He has speed if he lets himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
out, but he’s as wild as a hawk. Doesn’t seem
to know just where the plate is or what it is for.”</p>

<p>“Dan says Chesty can’t or won’t see.”</p>

<p>“Here come the fellows from the football field,”
said Ned quickly, as the eleven were seen approaching
on their way to the dressing-room. “I’m going
to ask Gus Kiggins and some of the fellows to come
in and bat. There’s Samson too,” he added. “I’ll
have him call strikes and balls. We’ll see now what
we’ll see.”</p>

<p>In response to Ned’s call four of the boys stopped
and acting upon Ned’s suggestion quickly agreed to
face Dan. The physical instructor good-naturedly
agreed to decide as to the balls and strikes and took
a position behind Ned.</p>

<p>The scrub game had served to “warm up” Dan
and, as Walter keenly watched him, more eager than
he would have acknowledged to have his words of
praise proved true, he smiled as he noticed that Dan
settled back in a way he recognized and understood.
Whenever Dan had his present expression
Walter had no fear.</p>

<p>Hodge, the heavy right tackle on the football team
and the heaviest hitter on the school nine, smilingly
grasped a bat and faced the pitcher. Gathering himself
together Hodge struck at the first ball Dan sent
in, but his bat failed to reach the elusive little
sphere and he joined in the laugh that greeted his
efforts.</p>

<p>“Look out, Hodge,” called Gus Kiggins. “It’ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
come back and hit you!” His tones were bantering
and it was plain that he was not looking upon the
work of the new boy in any serious way.</p>

<p>Again Dan sent in the ball, this time even swifter
than before, but as it reached the plate it suddenly
seemed to rise in the air and Hodge struck several
inches beneath it. An expression of surprise, almost
of chagrin, appeared upon the face of the tall player
and as he looked again at Dan there was an added
element of interest in his expression.</p>

<p>Once more the pitcher turned himself about and
Hodge braced himself for even a swifter ball, but
in spite of Dan’s contortions the ball slowly rose
and Hodge had struck at it long before it had
crossed the plate.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” called Samson sharply to the
batter, though he was looking keenly at Dan as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Come on, Smith. Try your luck,” said Hodge
to one of the other boys who was standing with
a bat in his hand awaiting his turn.</p>

<p>Smith, stout, stolid, manifestly possessed of great
strength, advanced laughingly to the plate and
keenly watched Dan. He struck viciously at the
first ball and a long foul followed. He lunged at
the next ball, but it seemed to dodge his bat. He
looked again at the pitcher, grasped his bat more
firmly, and then swung quickly at the ball which
Dan sent in with his utmost strength. “Strike!”
called Samson, then turning to the catcher, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
dropped the ball, he said, “What’s the trouble,
Ned? Can’t you hold him?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” replied Ned grimly, bracing himself.</p>

<p>Again the ball came swiftly, but Smith once more
failed to hit, and when Dan repeated his experiment
with Hodge by sending a slow ball and the
batter struck at it long before it reached him Smith
good-naturedly exclaimed as he threw down his
bat, “No use, fellows. You can’t find the ball.”</p>

<p>Gus Kiggins now walked to the plate. Without
knowing who was facing him, Dan felt that there
was opposition keen and strong expressed in the
face of the player. The interest of all in the little
group of spectators was aroused now, and Walter,
whose delight at Dan’s feat in striking out the two
heavy hitters of the school nine was unconcealed,
was watching the young pitcher with increasing
eagerness. If Gus Kiggins could be struck out too!
“Dan,” he said in a low voice, “give Gus a low
drop. He can’t hit a low ball.”</p>

<p>Without betraying whether or not he had heard
the suggestion, Dan looked keenly at the batter and
then sent in a sudden and terrifically swift ball that
crossed the plate before Gus had fairly drawn back
his bat. The ball was quickly returned by Ned,
and again, with his sudden quick swing, Dan threw
the ball before Gus was fully aware.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” called Samson in a low voice.</p>

<p>“You’re doing nobly!” laughed Hodge as he
watched the batter. “Look out for that third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
strike! The ball has a habit of stopping somewhere
up in the air and waiting for you to strike at it
before it decides to come on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for it,” retorted Kiggins and a moment
later he lunged heavily at the ball which Dan threw
with terrific speed.</p>

<p>“Three strikes! You’re out,” declared Samson.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Dan as he dropped the
ball and started from the field.</p>

<p>“Give us another round. You caught us off our
guard,” called Kiggins. Without a protest, Dan
once more picked up the ball, called to Ned to take
his position behind the bat, and prepared to resume
his work.</p>

<p>Again in order the three players faced the new
boy, but with the exception of a high foul which
Hodge raised, not one was able to hit the ball.</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” called Walter as he raced
in from the field. “This is enough. I’ve grown
stiff waiting for a ball to come my way. It wouldn’t
make any difference if you came to bat a dozen
times. It would be the same thing right over
again.” Walter’s elation at Dan’s success was great
now. The three heavy hitters of the school nine
had each struck out twice in succession as they
tried to hit the ball.</p>

<p>The face of Gus Kiggins was a study. Anger,
chagrin, rage—all were expressed in it. The sight
caused Walter to laugh, for he thought he understood
the feelings of the burly player. His interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
was keener when he saw that Samson had
advanced to Dan and was speaking warmly to him.
Ned, a moment later, joined the two and his enthusiasm
was unconcealed.</p>

<p>“Where did the country bumpkin come from?”
asked Gus Kiggins of Walter.</p>

<p>“Oh, I found him this summer. He struck out
fifteen in one game! He’s a wonder! I guess we’ll
all feel that the Tait School has somebody to take
Red’s place now.”</p>

<p>But Gus was scowling and looking at the new boy
with unconcealed anger. “Never mind, Gussie,”
continued Walter in mock sympathy. “We’ll let
you carry the bats for the nine if you’ll be good.”</p>

<p>At that moment Dan approached the group, and
as he drew near the expression of contempt which
he saw on the face of Gus Kiggins caused him to
stop and look inquiringly at his roommate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<small>A NEW PITCHER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Unaware of the expression on the face of
Gus Kiggins, Walter said to Dan as the
latter joined the group, “Didn’t I tell you? You’re
all right, Dan.” Then, turning to his companions,
he continued: “I always keep my eyes open for the
nine. You fellows seem to think the eleven is the
only team in school, but when I can find a pitcher
for the nine, such as I have in Dan Richards, I’m
telling you that you’ll forget there is such a game
as football when you see what the baseball nine will
do for us.”</p>

<p>“There’s a better way yet,” said Gus, looking
boldly at Walter as he spoke.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Hire two or three professionals,” sneered Gus.</p>

<p>“We don’t want them.”</p>

<p>“Might as well have them as to have ‘muckers.’”
The face of Gus was glowering, and his feeling was
manifest to all.</p>

<p>“We have some muckers already,” retorted Walter
hotly. He was angry at the reflection upon his
choice perhaps even more than at the slight cast
upon Dan. He glanced hastily at his roommate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
and from Dan’s unchanged manner he concluded
that he either did not know what a mucker was or
did not apply the epithet to himself.</p>

<p>“Who’s a mucker?” demanded Gus as he stopped
and faced Walter. “Do you mean to tell me that
I——”</p>

<p>“I am not mentioning any names,” broke in Walter
with a sneer. “When a fellow is a mucker he
doesn’t have to run around and wave a banner. It
is usually stamped on his face. If it isn’t, give
him a chance to open his mouth and he’ll do
the rest.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed at Walter’s retort and as they
looked at Gus it was plain that their sympathies
were not with him. Several glanced slyly at Dan,
but to all appearances he was the least-moved boy
in the group.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a mucker in the Tait School,” said
Gus savagely, “or at least there hasn’t been up to
to-day. Every fellow pays his way like a man and
he has something behind him too!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Walter tauntingly,
aroused still more by the manifest sympathy of his
companions. “How far back does a fellow have to
go not to be a mucker? Now, would you think
that a fellow whose father stuck pigs——”</p>

<p>“Say that again,” broke in Gus, his face livid and
his fist drawn back, “and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” taunted Walter, “that is the way some
fellows take to show that they are not muckers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>It was common report in the school that the
father of Gus Kiggins, who now was a prosperous
pork-packer, had begun his successful career as one
of the men employed by the establishment in which
he now was a partner. It was a well-known fact
that he had been one of the “hands” whose sole
occupation was slaughtering hogs.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to the fellows—no, I’ll leave it to
this fellow himself,” shouted Gus, as he stopped
and faced Dan, his companions also stopping at the
same time.</p>

<p>“Leave what to him?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Whether what I say is true or not.”</p>

<p>“That you’re a mucker?” asked Walter with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’ll just ask him one or two questions,
and if he answers them, then I’ll never say another
word if they’re not my way. If they prove what
I claim, then I’ll leave it with you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, take a rest, Gus. Calm down,” said Hodge.
“You talk too much.”</p>

<p>“Let him ask his questions,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any right to question you,” declared
Smith. “He hasn’t any more right than Hodge has
or I have. No, nor than you have to ask him questions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop him. I’ll answer two questions for
him if he’ll let me ask him two after he’s done with
me,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s fair. Go ahead, Gus,” said Hodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Gus, promptly turning to Dan.
“My first question is, Do you pay for your term-bills
in the Tait School or does someone else pay
for them? I know it’s none of my business in one
sense of the word——”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s none of your business!” broke
in Walter. “No one but a mucker would ever ask
a question like that anyway!”</p>

<p>For a moment Gus glared at the speaker, but
as Hodge and Smith instantly stepped in front of
him, no damage, at least physically, was done.
“You don’t have to answer such a fool question as
that,” said Hodge, turning to Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind answering it,” said Dan, apparently
unmoved. “I don’t mind telling you that I don’t
pay my bills here.”</p>

<p>“There! That’s just what I thought!” shouted
Gus and he was quick to mark the effect of Dan’s
acknowledgment. It was manifest that the reply
of Dan had somewhat dampened the ardor of the
boys. “Now, I’ve got just one question more.”</p>

<p>“It’ll keep,” said Smith curtly.</p>

<p>“Let me hear it,” protested Dan.</p>

<p>“I won’t ask you who pays your bills,” continued
Gus, “but I will ask you this: Now, honestly, wasn’t
it because you’re a good pitcher that this unknown
benefactor of yours offered to pay your way through
the Tait School?”</p>

<p>“Don’t answer his question, Dan!” spoke up
Walter hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>Ignoring the protest Dan looked straight into the
face of his accuser and said: “I shall have to say
both yes and no. I’ll own up that if I hadn’t been
a—if some people hadn’t thought I could pitch a
little—probably I wouldn’t be here now. But I
know too, that that isn’t the only reason why——”</p>

<p>“That’s all I want,” interrupted Gus triumphantly.
“You own up that you don’t pay your
own way, and you can’t deny that someone has
offered to send you because you think you can pitch
a little. That’s all I claimed. I haven’t anything
against you, you understand, but I rather guess
that Doctor Sprague won’t stand for such things.
The Tait School has too good a name to spoil it
now by hiring m—professionals,” he hastily interrupted
himself.</p>

<p>The boys glanced slyly at Dan, but he was silent.
His face flushed and it was plain that the brutal
words had cut deeply, although he tried not to show
it. Turning sharply, Hodge said:</p>

<p>“Richards, did you ever get money for playing
ball?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent!” spoke up Walter hastily.</p>

<p>“Let him answer for himself,” said Gus.</p>

<p>“No, I never was paid for a game,” answered
Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” declared Smith.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t settle it,” almost shouted Walter.
“I’ll tell you fellows just how it was——”</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” interrupted Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to tell,” persisted Walter, ignoring
his roommate’s words. “I’ll tell you just how
it was. Dan lives on a farm that is next to my
grandfather’s at Rodman. I’ve known him ever
since we both were kids. Four years ago his
father died, and Dan and his brother Tom have
been running the farm ever since. Of course, a fellow
that runs a farm nowadays doesn’t get the
chance to make as much money as some men do, but
Dan and Tom have managed to live and get a little
ahead too. They knew there was some money to
be made——”</p>

<p>“On a farm?” broke in Gus with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; on a farm!” retorted Walter hotly.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what they raised,” sneered Gus.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you—they raised hogs!” said Walter.
“You ought to know that hogs pay if there’s anyone
in the school that knows it.”</p>

<p>A shout arose from the boys, but Gus only glowered
at Walter. In a moment the latter continued:
“Dan decided this summer that he would take the
little money he had made and saved by raising hogs
and doing other little jobs, like rowing for the
men that wanted to go fishing on Six Town Pond,
and go to school. He had about decided that he
would go to the normal school, for he’d have a
chance there to work and pay for part of his board,
and there wasn’t any tuition to pay for anyway.
My father heard of Dan’s plan and he told him
that if he would room with me and do me good he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
would send him to the Tait School. Now, the way
I look at it, it’s Dan who is doing the favor——”</p>

<p>“Of course he is!” broke in Hodge warmly. “It
was mighty good of him to come, I think. I guess
if he hadn’t shown that he had that ‘fade-away’
ball Gus wouldn’t have kicked. It’s too bad, Gussie,”
he added with a laugh, as he turned to his
companion. “You’re a near-pitcher anyway, and
that’s something, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go out and hire some professional
to take Ned’s place as catcher?” demanded
the angry Gus.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned’s all right. He’ll learn how to hold the
new pitcher when he has had a little more practice.”
Hodge looked at Ned, who had been thoughtfully
silent throughout the quarrel, and laughed as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in it!” declared Gus, “and I’ll
bet you that Doctor Sprague won’t either, when he
finds out about it.”</p>

<p>“Run and tell him now, Gussie,” suggested Smith.</p>

<p>“I’m no telltale.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Smith. “If Doctor
Sprague doesn’t hear of it, we’ll believe you.”</p>

<p>“He’ll know without my telling him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no he won’t, Gussie boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Who’ll tell him?”</p>

<p>“I shall.”</p>

<p>“You!” exclaimed Gus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dan. “I don’t want to play on the
nine if there is any question about my right.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right,” said Hodge. “All you have
to do is to saw wood.”</p>

<p>“I guess he can do that,” sneered Gus.</p>

<p>“He can, if he can do it as well as he can pitch—or
stick hogs!” retorted Walter.</p>

<p class="cap">“You stirred up the animals, Walter,” said
Hodge after Gus had taken his departure.
“Don’t do it any more. Gussie is all right enough
if you don’t bear on too hard. Look at the shoulders
on him. No wonder he’s the next to the best
boxer in school. The trouble with him is that he
counted upon being the pitcher on the school nine
next spring, that’s all. It’s a little bit rough, you
know, to be waked up by an earthquake.”</p>

<p>“He stands about as much chance of being
pitcher as I do of being King of Timbuctoo or of
Oshkosh,” sniffed Walter.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t have a ghost of a show if Richards
can do again what he did to-day,—strike out the
three heaviest hitters on the nine,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and strike out each of them twice in succession,”
added Walter.</p>

<p>“Good work, old man!” said Hodge affectionately
patting Dan on the shoulder. “We’ll leave
you here. Look out for Gus. If he meets you
alone some dark night he may pitch into you.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Carlton,” said Dan, as he and his roommate
were about to enter their hall. “What’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
wrong?” The little fellow’s face was pale and it
was manifest that he had been crying.</p>

<p>“Somebody poured water in my bed,” said Carlton.
“My room is all mussed up too. I—I think
I’ll——”</p>

<p>“You’ll what?” asked Dan kindly as the boy
hesitated.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’ll write my mother and ask her
to let me come home.”</p>

<p>“No, no. That isn’t the way. I’ll go over with
you, and we’ll set matters to rights in a minute. Do
you know who did it?”</p>

<p>“I think I do. I am almost sure——”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let him know that you know, whoever
it is.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because you may have more trouble if you do.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to sleep in a wet bed. I’ll
catch cold.”</p>

<p>“Take your bedding off and let it dry.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll pour more water on it if I do.”</p>

<p>“I guess not.”</p>

<p>“Hello; got a protector have you?” Dan looked
up as he heard the question, and saw Gus Kiggins
before him. “Well, you’ll need his help, I guess,”
continued Gus, as he looked again at the troubled
little lad. “He wants his mamma, doesn’t he?
Poor little darling! Do the naughty bad boys
plague him? He mustn’t play with muckers. It
is naughty and it is not nice. Come——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“That’s enough!” broke in Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Enough of what?” demanded Gus as he instantly
turned to face Dan. His manner betrayed
his anger and it was manifest that he resented the
quiet words of the new boy.</p>

<p>“Enough of picking on a little fellow,” said Dan
steadily.</p>

<p>“What is it to you?”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t stand by and see Carlton abused.”</p>

<p>“He needs a little attention—and so do you!
And you’ll both get it.”</p>

<p>Dan did not move from his position nor did he
reply to the words of his angry classmate. As he
looked at Gus he saw that the boy undoubtedly was
possessed of great physical strength. He was not
any taller than he, but was much heavier. Dan recalled
too, what one of the boys had said, that “Gus
Kiggins was one of the best boxers in the Tait
School.” The fellow was angry now and not only
inclined to quarrel, but apparently ready to seek
trouble. Dan was also aware of the feeling of
jealousy which doubtless had been aroused by what
he had seen of his pitching in the scrub game of
baseball. “Here comes Squint!” exclaimed Gus
suddenly in a low voice, as the teacher who was in
charge of the entry came into the hall. “That saves
you this time, but if you don’t learn how to mind
your own business you’ll get some teaching that
isn’t down in the catalogue!” With this parting
threat Gus turned and left the hall. The teacher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
nodded to the two boys who remained in the entry,
and at once entered his room.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! Thank you!” exclaimed Carlton
to Dan.</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For taking my part against that big bully.”</p>

<p>“Has he ever troubled you before?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He pulled my ears this morning, and
when I cried he picked me up in his arms and held
me over the balusters.”</p>

<p>“What did you do then?”</p>

<p>“I cried—a little.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Because I was scared. He might have dropped
me,” replied Carlton, unable to conceal his surprise
as he looked at Dan.</p>

<p>“Did it make him stop when you cried?”</p>

<p>“No. He is a big bully! I guess he’ll find out
that I don’t like him very well!”</p>

<p>Dan repressed the smile that rose to his lips
and looked down at the little fellow before him.
Plainly Carlton was a “spoiled” boy who never
had been taught to consider anyone but himself.
What a multitude of new elements the shrinking
selfish little lad had to learn!</p>

<p>“Do you think Gus Kiggins will cry when he
finds out that you don’t like him very well, Carlton?”
Dan inquired quizzically.</p>

<p>“He’s just a big bully, that’s all he is!” said
Carlton. “I don’t like the boys here anyway. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
guess I’ll go home. My mother told me I might
leave if I didn’t want to stay.”</p>

<p>“What will your father say?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any father. He’s dead.”</p>

<p>“Have you any brothers?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Dan’s knowledge of life was limited, but he
thought he saw plainly the training which Carlton
had received. Doubtless, he surmised, the boy’s
mother in her loneliness and grief had devoted herself
to the only child she had. His every wish was
granted, his will never was thwarted, and he ruled
his mother as a tyrant might have done.</p>

<p>“Carlton,” Dan said quietly, “what do the fellows
call the boy that runs away or cries when
he has something hard to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what they call him and I don’t
care. I won’t stand it to have that big bully pull my
ears or let the boys pour water in my bed! My
mother——”</p>

<p>“Did you know my father is dead too?” broke
in Dan.</p>

<p>“No. Is he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got a lot of hard things to learn too.
I am sure I shall feel just as you do many times,
but I’m not going to run. The boys all think the
fellow that runs away is a coward.”</p>

<p>“But you’re big and strong.”</p>

<p>“In some ways.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t afraid of Gus Kiggins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“No, but there are some other things that I’m
afraid of.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“A good many.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve thought already of doing just what
you say you’re going to do, but I’ve decided to stay
and fight it out.”</p>

<p>“I can’t fight.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll try you’ll soon learn.”</p>

<p>“Will you show me how?” asked Carlton
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you all I know, but that isn’t much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is! I know it is! I’m coming over to
have you show me. I’d like to find out——”</p>

<p>“Come whenever you want to,” said Dan as he
smiled and at once departed from the hall. As he
walked to his room he was thinking of what the
little fellow had said. He wanted to run away from
his troubles. “That’s just like me,” said Dan to
himself. “I haven’t learned to do what a lot of
the fellows here have, and just because it’s hard
for me to learn I wanted to play the baby act too.
Well, I guess Carlton and I are in the same boat.
We’ll have to learn how to paddle or just be carried
down stream. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked Walter as Dan
entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I went over to his room with that Carlton
Hall. He’s a little fellow and a new boy—green in
some ways as I am,” Dan added.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“He’s having his troubles. The boys upset his
room, pour water in his bed—and——”</p>

<p>“That’s enough, isn’t it!” laughed Walter. “Oh
well, it’s a hard row to hoe, but it’ll do him good.
He’ll learn pretty soon how to pitch into the fellows
and drive them out. It’s the only way. Dan,
you did yourself proud to-day.”</p>

<p>“Did I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you did! The fellows are wild about
you. When you struck out Hodge and Smith and
Gus Kiggins, our three heaviest hitters, twice in
succession they all said you were surely the real
thing.”</p>

<p>“Did Gus Kiggins say so?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” laughed Walter. “His nose is
out of joint. You wouldn’t exactly expect him to
be happy over such a thing.”</p>

<p>“No,” assented Dan.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right though, he’ll have to be. He
isn’t very popular with the fellows anyhow.”</p>

<p>“He can play ball.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a good player all right enough, but
he’s a dirty player. He was center on the football
team last fall, but Samson wouldn’t let him hold
down the place.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Gus had a way when the ball was snapped
back of grabbing dirt in each hand and then rubbing
it into the eyes of the center of the other team.
Then he had a trick of grabbing the other center
right by the leg and pinching his muscles so hard
that the fellow was limp as a rag. Of course it
wasn’t so bad when it came to his putting up a
game like that with the Military Academy. They’re
a lot of muckers themselves and any trick is fair
in war, you know.”</p>

<p>“Gus Kiggins said I was a mucker.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he did, but you mustn’t mind a
little thing like that. Gus is sore.”</p>

<p>“Sore?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” laughed Walter. “He’d counted
upon being the pitcher of the school nine next
spring. Naturally he doesn’t enjoy having you take
his place. You wouldn’t like it yourself.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t taken his place yet.”</p>

<p>“You’re dead sure of it, Dan, if you can keep
up such work as you were doing this afternoon. All
the fellows say so. They’re warm for forming the
new league too. I think myself it’s a sure thing.
We’ll have the pennant in baseball too, if you pitch
your game. Dan, you’ll be the king!”</p>

<p>Dan smiled at the suggestion, though the words
of praise were sweet to him. To an extent they
served to drive away some of the darker feelings
that had been in his mind. He decided in his quiet
way that he would keep his eyes open and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
some of the things in which he was aware that his
training was deficient might be improved without
his roommate referring to them, for in spite of his
unassuming ways Dan was keenly sensitive to the
suggestions for improvement which Walter felt free
to make.</p>

<p>That same evening after supper Smith, Hodge,
and Ned all came to Dan’s room, and their words of
praise for the work of the afternoon were doubly
soothing to Dan’s troubled heart. After all, perhaps,
he was not entirely out of place among the
boys of the Tait School, he thought.</p>

<p>As the conversation turned to other matters and
Ned’s words kept his companions in good humor,
Dan felt himself strongly drawn to the boy. Sturdy,
thickly set, his round face plain in feature, but
lighted up by his love of fun and his manifest
friendliness for everyone, Dan decided that Ned
was one of the boys to whom anyone might turn
with confidence. Whatever Ned’s defects might be,
he was true.</p>

<p>“Look here, Ned,” Smith was saying, “do you
see that scar on my cheek?”</p>

<p>“I do,” replied Ned. “What of it?”</p>

<p>“I got it in the cars the other day. I had to
stand, and right in front of me was a woman who
had a long hatpin in her hat. I tell you such
things ought to be stopped by law. I’m opposed to
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re against long hatpins, so to speak,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
laughed Ned. “Well, I’ve been against them myself
several times.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Hodge as the boys
laughed. “You want to keep away from those
things.”</p>

<p>“My father told me just before I left home how
to keep the doctor away,” said Smith.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away.’ That’s
poetry. You fellows might not know it, so I’m repeating
it for your benefit.”</p>

<p>“I know something better than an apple to keep
him away,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“An onion. That’ll keep the doctor and everybody
else away too.”</p>

<p>“Ned, we’ll have to shut you up if you don’t quit
that,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“That makes me think of something that happened
at home just before I left for school,” continued
Ned, unabashed. “My father was looking
for a new chauffeur. There was one chap that
applied for the place that my father rather liked,
though I didn’t agree with him exactly. Finally my
father asked the fellow how long he had been in
his last position. ‘Five years,’ the fellow told him.
‘That’s a good record—a remarkably good record
in these days,’ my father said. You know he always
says ‘these days’ as if he thought the world somehow
was running down and was almost out, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
worst of it is he always looks straight at me when
he says it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why,” suggested Hodge soberly.</p>

<p>“I wonder about it too,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, go on with your chauffeur,” said Smith.
“We’ve got to hear about him, I suppose, so let’s
get through with it. I’ve got something I want to
say, but no one ever has a chance when Ned is
around. He even talks in his sleep. You wind him
up and——”</p>

<p>“Keep still there, you one of a million varieties.
I’m doing this. Where was I when you broke in
with your drivel?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“You were giving us a long-drawn-out tale of
your new chauffeur,” said Walter. “Probably all
you wanted was to let us know that you had a car.
What kind is it?”</p>

<p>“The kind that little Alexander and little Moses
had in the bulrushes,” suggested Hodge. “The kind
that mother used to make.”</p>

<p>“This applicant for the proud position of chauffeur
in my ancestral domicile——”</p>

<p>“Be-a-u-ti-ful language,” drawled Smith. “My,
I wish I could talk that way.”</p>

<p>“This applicant said, in response to my father’s
question,” continued Ned unabashed, “that he had
been five years in his last place. ‘Fine record,’
said my pater, much delighted. ‘Why did you
leave?’ he then asked the chap.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I know the answer to that,” said Hodge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
“That came over in the Mayflower. That was told
to J. Smith by Pocahontas.”</p>

<p>“What was the answer. I never heard it,” said
Walter.</p>

<p>“Why, the fellow left his last place because he
was pardoned out or his term had expired, I forget
which,” groaned Hodge.</p>

<small>A CHANGE IN WALTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dan had not taken any part in the bantering of
the boys, but he none the less enjoyed their
light and easy way of looking at life. It was all
very different from his own early experiences.
Since the death of his father life had been a hard
struggle. Every penny had to be counted with care
and the work on the farm was exacting. Early
and late he had toiled, though he never had thought
of complaining. Tom and his mother were laboring
as hard as he. Indeed, most of his neighbors
knew no more than he did of the lighter side of life.</p>

<p>As the new boy listened to the conversation, he
had enjoyed it all, though it was difficult for him
to understand how it was possible for his friends to
throw aside apparently all feeling of responsibility.
Someone must be working, and working hard too,
to provide the means by which all the advantages
which were given them were to be had. And yet
no one seemed to be thinking of that nor of any
responsibility that came with such privileges. Although
Dan was happy in his quiet way, he was
still at a loss to understand his friends. Their home
training had been different from his, their lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
had been easy, plenty of money had been given
them, even their very clothing had an air which
Dan now realized made his own appear in a light
of which he had never once thought. As far as
Rodman was concerned, he had always felt that he
appeared as well as any of the country boys—that
is, if he ever thought of such things at all.</p>

<p>At the Tait School, however, all was changed,
and though Dan did not quite understand as yet in
just what the difference consisted, he still was
conscious that in his life some of the elements that
appealed strongly to him were lacking. Perhaps
he was equally unaware that he himself was possessed
of certain very desirable qualities that were
lacking in the well-dressed, self-possessed boys who
made up the new world into which he had entered.</p>

<p>As the days passed, Dan found himself compelled
to work hard in order to maintain a place in the
classes to which he had been assigned. He had
been out of school several years, and the work
which he had tried to do alone and even that in
which Moulton had directed him had left him
poorly prepared. But there was in the country
boy a spirit of determination that counted for
much. Mr. Hale, one of the teachers, had apparently
taken a special interest in the new boy.
“Remember, Richards,” he said to Dan one day,
“ninety per cent of success means work. Indeed,
that is about all there is of it anyway. Genius is
said to be a capacity for work, and not much else.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
The great man is the man who can do more than
others. If you work you’ll win. Of course it must
be the right kind of work and it must be in the right
way, for there is a deal of difference between
mere activity and true work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I quite understand,” Dan had said.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale laughed as he continued, “Did you
see that house that was being moved down the
street yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you notice that the men had a horse to
wind the rope around the windlass and so pull the
building?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I saw that.”</p>

<p>“Well, yesterday afternoon I stopped to watch
them a few minutes. The poor old horse was
freed from his task a minute, the rope was being
adjusted, I fancy, or there were some boards to be
moved or something to be done. But the poor
old horse didn’t know. Without a word being
spoken to him he started in on his task again.
Around and around he traveled, keeping it up
until the men took pity on him and stopped him.
He—I mean the horse, of course—didn’t know
the difference, although he wasn’t accomplishing a
thing. The rope was not adjusted and in spite of
his steady trot around the windlass he wasn’t moving
the house an inch. He was ‘active’ enough,
but he wasn’t doing any real work. Do you see
what I mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I think I do,” said Dan thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know you do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll come out all right in the end.
You come to school to get your brains in working
order, but don’t forget that you must use your
brains in your work as well as learn how to work
your brains.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Some of the boys here, even when they are
studying with a teacher, think they are studying just
because they are holding books in their hands.
They’re like poor old Dobbin, who kept up his
weary round when there wasn’t any rope to be
wound by the windlass.”</p>

<p>Dan’s eagerness to learn now increased with the
passing days. He was determined to profit by the
friendly advice of Mr. Hale. His own eagerness
to learn was an additional incentive, born as it was
of a daily increasing consciousness of his own deficiencies.
His work in the classroom as yet was not
sufficiently high to permit him to do his studying in
his own room, but in his heart he was glad that
the rule was enforced, for he thought that he could
gain more in this way than if he had been left to
himself. Dan’s mind did not work rapidly, but his
steady and persistent efforts were already beginning
to count and every passing week found him a little
farther advanced. The work was hard and at times
so discouraging to the new boy that he thought of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
giving it all up and returning to the farm. However,
he did not refer to his feeling in the presence
of his friends and fought so hard against it that the
temptation to give up became less with the rapidly
passing days.</p>

<p>Most of his friends in his own form or class were
also among those who were denied the privilege
of studying in their rooms, Ned being the only one
to have a standing sufficiently high to obtain the
privilege. Hodge, Smith, Gus Kiggins, and Walter
were loud in their complaints at being compelled
to do their work under the eye of Mr. Hale. Indeed,
Walter asserted repeatedly that he was denied
the privilege because of a prejudice against him,
instead of his being judged on the merits of his
work.</p>

<p>As for Gus, Dan soon found that the boy was
so deeply interested in the work of the football
team that apparently he had ignored or forgotten
his anger at the new boy. The league between the
four schools had been successfully arranged and the
football games of the fall were to be included. The
four officers of the league were made up of representatives
of the different schools, Ned being the
vice-president, while the Military Academy obtained
the presidency by virtue of its success in the contests
of the preceding year.</p>

<p>Carlton Hall too had gathered courage to meet
at least a part of his problems. Though it was
difficult for him to learn to rely upon himself, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
had followed Dan’s advice and had no longer railed
at the boys who made his life one of discomfort
and his room difficult to live in. Even the threats
of Gus Kiggins had, in a measure, ceased, for the
school bully, in his deep interest in the work of the
football team, had little time left for his petty tormenting
of the homesick and innocent little lad
who had been placed in the school by his mother in
the fond hope that there he would acquire what
she could not conceal from herself he was not
having under her weak and selfish indulgence.</p>

<p>Occasionally Dan had been out on the diamond
with Samson, the gym instructor and trainer, but
the work had been only occasional. The trainer was
also the coach of the eleven and his duties did not
leave much spare time. On the other hand, Dan’s
eagerness to work on his studies had caused him
to make use of the occasional half-holidays in consulting
with Mr. Hale or in studying in his own
room. His success in striking out the three heavy
hitters as he had on his first appearance on the
diamond had established a certain reputation for
him, which steadily grew. He was awkward in his
manner and very quiet-spoken in his intercourse
with his fellow students, although he was invariably
pleasant in his dealings. As a consequence he had
come to occupy a unique position in the life of the
school.</p>

<p>Great things were expected of him, as he very
well knew, and yet, at the same time, though he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
was respected, he was not the intimate friend of
any. Ned had been with him, perhaps, more than
any other boy, and the two classmates were in the
way of becoming fast friends. As for Walter,
his enthusiasm had apparently reached its highest
point at the beginning of the term and had been
running down ever since. There were times when,
to Dan, his presence in Walter’s room seemed to be
a source of irritation which the latter was at no
pains to conceal. Dan, after his usual quiet manner,
did not refer to what he saw nor to his own
feelings. He was still the same quiet earnest boy
that he was when he had first entered the Tait
School.</p>

<p>He was troubled far more than he would acknowledge
by the growing intimacy of Walter and Gus.
The latter had been a frequent visitor in their
rooms, where he either ignored Dan or made some
slighting remark which was intended to hurt. But
as Dan seldom retorted, the pleasure of the attempt
was soon lost and of late it had been Walter who
had made the visits, seeking out Gus’s room several
times daily. Twice Dan ventured to remonstrate
with his roommate, but each time Walter was angry,
and as Dan discovered that his protests apparently
did more harm than good he soon ceased his endeavors,
although he still was deeply troubled by
the growing intimacy.</p>

<p>In this manner the fall days passed and the
settled routine of the life in the Tait School became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
less irksome to Dan. He was steadily improving
in his work, a fact which was noted by Walter as
well as by others.</p>

<p>“Dan, you’re just making a grind of yourself,”
said Walter irritably one day when the two boys
were by themselves in their room.</p>

<p>“Am I?” asked Dan good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are. There are some things for a
fellow to learn in school besides Latin and math.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have noticed that,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Then, why don’t you pay some attention to
them?” asked Walter sharply, his growing irritation
becoming still more manifest. “I didn’t want
to room with a ‘chump.’”</p>

<p>Dan’s face flushed, as in a low voice he said,
“What do you want me to do, Walter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, stir around and do something. You’re
never down to see the eleven at work. You didn’t
even come out to yell when we played the Atlas
High School off its feet. You just mope around over
your books the whole time. I don’t believe you’ve
been out enough to keep your arm in shape, now
have you?”</p>

<p>“Not very often,” admitted Dan.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you do it? You know what the
fellows expect. If you don’t make the nine I’ll be
the laughing-stock of the whole school. Brace up,
Dan! Gus Kiggins says——”</p>

<p>“What does he say?” inquired Dan as his roommate
hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” said Walter, laughing a
little uneasily. “I guess that Gus thinks about
what all the fellows do.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Dan. You’ve just got to get into
the school life, and that’s all there is about it.
You’re nothing but a grind.”</p>

<p>“If I were paying my own way I might feel differently.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother your head about that. I guess
my father won’t complain if I don’t. What he
wants is to——”</p>

<p>“To what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be satisfied if I am,” declared Walter
lightly. “Why don’t you come out to-morrow and
get a look at the team? We play the Military
Academy next week, you know, and we want every
fellow on deck. It’s our hardest game. If you
don’t show any school spirit how do you think the
fellows will feel when it’s your turn? You’ll want
backing when you’re pitching against the Military
Academy nine.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come if you want me to,” said Dan quietly.
“But——” Dan stopped abruptly as Gus Kiggins
entered the room.</p>

<small>DAN’S TROUBLES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“How’s your shadow?” asked Gus, as he seated
himself in an easy-chair and looked at Dan.</p>

<p>“My shadow?” inquired Dan. “I don’t know
what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that little white-livered milksop that tags
you most of the time. For my part, I think he
needs a nurse-maid.”</p>

<p>“You mean that little fellow in the fourth form—Carlton
Hall?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s his name,” laughed Gus. “It
rhymes with bawl. He ought never to have left
his mother. He’s a mamma’s darling all right,
though he seems to have taken you up in her place.
What do you get for looking after his nursing-bottle?”</p>

<p>For several weeks, indeed ever since the time
when Dan had interfered with the school bully in
his tormenting little Carlton Hall, Gus to all appearances
had ignored or forgotten the ill will which
he had manifested for the new member of his own
class. He had been indifferent rather than openly
unfriendly, and Dan had been well content to be left
alone. His dislike for his rough and brutal classmate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
had become stronger as he noticed his growing
intimacy with Walter, who was quickly and easily
influenced by his surroundings. Dan now understood
a part of the reason why Mr. Borden had
offered to send him to the Tait School though he
grimly resolved never to betray his knowledge to
anyone, least of all to Walter.</p>

<p>The present visit and sneering words of Gus
were somewhat unexpected and Dan suspected that
there was more behind them than he was able to
see at the present time. His voice did not betray
his anger at the contemptuous question of his
visitor and without further conversation he quietly
prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>“Where you going, Dan?” said Walter.</p>

<p>“Don’t hinder little Carlton’s nurse,” laughed
Gus. “The poor child may need his bottle. He
wants somebody to play with him. Don’t you know
that good little boys die young?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Gus?” demanded
Walter, nevertheless laughing at the taunting words
of his classmate.</p>

<p>“Nothing the matter with me!” declared Gus.
“I’m fit. I was never in better form in my life.
I wish the game with the Military Academy was to-morrow
instead of a week from Saturday. I want
a chance to line up against Hackett. Last year he
served me a trick that I haven’t forgotten. No one
ever does that to me and lives to tell the tale.” As
he spoke, the bully looked brutally at Dan, as if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
there was some vague and implied threat in his
words.</p>

<p>“You’re enough for any fellow in the school,”
laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“Am I? Well, you tell your rube roommate
that if he can keep his little friend’s mouth shut he’ll
be doing him a mighty friendly turn. It will be
better for everybody concerned.”</p>

<p>“What has he been doing now?”</p>

<p>“Setting Mr. Hale after me,” said Gus angrily.
“What do you think is the latest?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any idea,” replied Walter. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“Hale told me that if any more trouble was made
in pretty little Carlton’s room one or two members
of the team would be shut out from the games.”</p>

<p>“Did he mean you?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. If he didn’t, why did he speak to
me in that way?”</p>

<p>“You know better than I do,” laughed Walter, as
Dan looked steadily at their visitor, though he did
not speak.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me keep you,” continued Gus, looking
again at Dan. “Why do you linger so long? If
you want to go and play horse or Injun with your
little pal, don’t let me prevent you. My only
suggestion is that you tell the nice little boy that
if he ‘blabs’ on me again he will want to arrange
for the coroner. And so will anyone who tries to
set him up to such tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Gus’s face flushed an angry red as he spoke
directly to Dan, while Walter was looking in wonder
first at one boy and then at the other.</p>

<p>“The little fellow has a right to protect himself,”
said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“‘Protect himself’!” said Gus scornfully.
“There isn’t any place in the Tait School for a
telltale.”</p>

<p>“How much of a place is there for a coward
who picks out some little chap who can’t defend
himself and spends his time picking on him?”</p>

<p>“Do you say I am a coward?” shouted Gus,
drawing back his fist threateningly.</p>

<p>“You know better than I do,” retorted Dan
quietly. “I’m sorry if Carlton has been telling Mr.
Hale about your dirty tricks. I don’t believe he
has, but even if he did, he wasn’t going beyond his
rights. His mother pays a lot of money to send
him here and she has a right to expect that her
boy shall get her money’s worth. If any fellow
tries to——”</p>

<p>“Do you say I am a coward?” Gus again broke
in loudly.</p>

<p>“I haven’t said so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you have! You feel mighty safe to talk
that way here in the dormitory where the teachers
can hear everything. Come on down to the field!
I’ll show you whether I’m a coward or not! I’ll
meet you any time you say!” Gus raised his voice
and fairly shouted his defiance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span></p>

<p>“You talk like a brave man,” said Dan in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I’m no mucker anyway!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you? You might ask some of the boys
what they think.”</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>“With you? You get out of this room!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll put me out,” sneered Gus. “Or
no, perhaps you’ll run and cry. Go tell Mr. Sharp,
he’s in charge of this hall. Tell him to come and
help you. That’s what you’ve been setting up your
baby to do. I know you! You’ve set him up to tell
tales of me, so that you could get me in trouble
and you wouldn’t have to do any work to get a
place on the nine this spring——”</p>

<p>“Will you leave the room?” broke in Dan.</p>

<p>“When I get ready. Want me to go before?”</p>

<p>Dan waited to hear no more. He turned suddenly
and seized the bully by the back and before
Gus was able to realize the situation he was out
of the room. But the school bully was a powerful
boy, and was twisting and turning in his efforts to
break the hold of Dan. As the two struggling
boys came into the hall they found themselves face
to face with Mr. Sharp. Instantly they released
their grasp and, with an air of apparent indifference,
Gus said, “All right, Richards, I’ll see
you again.” The boy tried to speak indifferently,
although his breathing was labored and his face
betrayed his anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this, young gentlemen?”
demanded Mr. Sharp, as he looked at the
boys. The teacher was a mild-mannered, inoffensive
man, whose dealings with the boys lacked many
of the qualities that had made Mr. Hale respected
as well as beloved by all the students in the school.
“Don’t you know that scuffling in the rooms and in
the halls is forbidden?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“I am surprised at you, Richards,” continued
Mr. Sharp, his face betraying an increasing annoyance.
“This is the first time I have known of your
breaking the school rules.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t anything to be said, Mr.
Sharp.”</p>

<p>“What have you to say, Kiggins?” demanded
the teacher irritably.</p>

<p>“We were only fooling,” muttered Gus.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it was, Mr. Sharp!” spoke up
Walter. “They didn’t mean to break the rules.
It isn’t study-hour——”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” interrupted Mr.
Sharp. “I shall give you each ten marks and
place you both on the ‘limits’ for a week.”</p>

<p>“But I’m on the eleven, Mr. Sharp,” protested
Gus. “That will keep me from practising with the
team and we’re to play the Military Academy next
week.” Twenty-five marks caused a boy to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
suspended, and to be given “the limits” was to prevent
him from leaving the school grounds, even to
go to the athletic field during the days for which
the sentence was declared.</p>

<p>“You should have thought of that,” said Mr.
Sharp.</p>

<p>“But I must go. There isn’t any other way. I’ll
appeal to the doctor.”</p>

<p>“A repetition of such a threat will bring you
ten marks more,” said Mr. Sharp pettishly. “Go to
your room and remain there until the bell rings
for supper! I am deeply chagrined to find you,
Richards, in such a scrape as this,” the teacher
again said as he turned to Dan. “I expected better
things of you.”</p>

<p>Dan did not reply and in a brief time he and
Walter entered their room and closed the door.</p>

<p>“That’s a smart trick you’ve played this time,
Dan Richards,” said Walter fiercely when the two
boys were by themselves.</p>

<p>“I haven’t played any trick.”</p>

<p>“What did you order Gus to leave the room
for?”</p>

<p>“I wanted him to get out.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t have any business to tell him
that. Remember, this is my room. When I want
a fellow to leave I’ll tell him to go. I sha’n’t ask
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember that I asked you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t. That’s half the trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>“Well, Gus Kiggins went, didn’t he?” asked
Dan grimly.</p>

<p>“You caught him when he wasn’t looking.
You’ve got yourself in a mess now. A week’s
‘limits’ and ten marks! You’ll think that’s a picnic
though compared with what Gus will do to you.
He’s the best boxer in the school.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Dan; we might as well have this
out now as any time. If you think you’re going
to order my friends out of my room any time you
take a notion you’re mistaken, that’s all! I won’t
stand for it.”</p>

<p>“Walter, you’d better draw a line through the
room then; if you want to you can have such
fellows as Gus Kiggins on your side. I simply don’t
want him on my side of the line.”</p>

<p>“Who pays for this room?”</p>

<p>“Your father, as I have frequently heard you
say.”</p>

<p>“Well, he pays for the whole room, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes—half of it for you and half for me. If I
had known what I had to put up with, you might
have had a roommate like Gus Kiggins.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t the only fellow in school that has
ten marks and the ‘limits’ for a week.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“I guess my father will think it’s a toss up.”</p>

<p>“He’ll soon know.”</p>

<p>“How? Are you going to tell my father about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
him?” asked Walter, his alarm betraying itself in
his manner.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t mention the name of Gus Kiggins.
I shall write your father about my part.”</p>

<p>“But you might as well tell him about Gus. He’ll
know just as soon as he hears from you.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Will you write him then?”</p>

<p>“I? Why should I write him?”</p>

<p>“I thought you thought it was better for you to
write than for me.”</p>

<p>“Will you write if I don’t?”</p>

<p>“I shall.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know why?”</p>

<p>“Because I want him to have the facts—that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll write him,” said Walter hastily.</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“And look here, Dan. I didn’t just mean what
I said. I don’t want to be a cad. I didn’t—I wish
I hadn’t said what I did.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“You know,” said Walter foolishly. “I mean
about the room.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Dan in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I was just a little worried, Dan. Gus Kiggins
has his faults, but then he isn’t the worst fellow
in school. But I don’t want you to have any
trouble——”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“He’s the best fighter in school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>“You mean best or worst?”</p>

<p>“Either,” replied Walter, with an uneasy laugh.
“I don’t want you to queer yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to myself,” said Dan good-naturedly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<small>CHANGED RELATIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The relations between Dan and Walter were
daily becoming more strained. Gus Kiggins
was a less frequent visitor than he had been
formerly, but Dan was convinced that this simply
meant that Walter was spending more time in the
room or company of the boy for whom Dan had
formed an intense dislike. The threatened trouble
between himself and Gus apparently had vanished
and even little Carlton Hall was not troubled as he
formerly had been. The lad was a bright little fellow
and in the classroom was already making a
reputation for his quickness. Now that his first
feeling of homesickness was gone and there had
come a comparative freedom from his tormentors,
Carlton was entering more fully into the spirit of
the life of the school.</p>

<p>For Dan the little fellow’s admiration, as well as
his devotion, steadily increased. More and more
Carlton sought Dan’s room and company. If Walter
objected, he did not say so, though his unconcealed
contempt was not lacking. But Dan and
Walter, though they occupied the same rooms, were
no longer such warm friends as once they had been.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
There were not many times when the boys quarreled.
It was rather an absence of all friendly
relations that marked their daily lives.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed Dan’s steady work began to
tell. After the Christmas vacation he was among
the few boys of his class who were permitted to
study in their rooms instead of in the study-room,
where the other boys assembled every afternoon
and evening and did their work under the direction
of a teacher, who for Dan’s class was Mr. Sharp.
At first Dan had almost decided to keep on with
his work in the study-room, because of his feeling
that he could do better work there, but his lack
of respect for this particular teacher finally led him
to accept the privilege and his study-hours were
therefore spent in the quiet of his own room.</p>

<p>A strong friendship had sprung up between
Hodge, Ned, Smith, and Dan. At the Christmas
holidays the three boys had been visitors in Dan’s
home in Rodman. The country life in winter had
been so new and novel to the visitors that the three
boys had highly enjoyed their vacation-time. The
fact that Dan’s home was a humble one apparently
only served to increase the feeling of friendliness
which they had for Dan, while for his quiet little
mother everyone had an admiration that was as
strong as the respect and affection for her boy. Dan
had urged Walter to come to Rodman with his
friends, but the latter had curtly declined and Dan
had not repeated the invitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>On the train which the four boys took when the
day of departure from Rodman arrived, Dan and
Ned were seated together. The enthusiasm of
Dan’s friends over their visit was keen and in
course of their conversation Ned said to Dan: “It’s
simply great! I never coasted right over the tops
of fences before. The crust was hard enough to
hold up a horse.”</p>

<p>“The coasting is all right,” replied Dan lightly.
“It is the snow-shovel that is the instrument of
torture. When you have shoveled through two
or three of those eight-foot drifts you lose a little
of your enthusiasm for snow that sometimes comes
in November and stays right with us till April.
Last year we had a hundred and forty-three days
of sleighing.”</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed Ned. “That is what puts
the breath of life into you. I can understand now
where you get some of the nerve you’ve shown.”</p>

<p>“‘Nerve’! I don’t know that I have any nerve.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have, whether you know it or not.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s because you’re my friend that you
say that.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. It takes nerve to do what you’re
doing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Dan, I know it’s none of my business,
but I’ve sometimes been afraid you’d leave
school.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” asked Dan, though his face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
betrayed something of his feeling, which was not
altogether surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, we all know—it’s none of my business,”
said Ned lamely. “I don’t suppose I ought to
speak of such things.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, you know,” said Ned hesitatingly, “all
the fellows understand how it is that you are in
the Tait School.”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Borden pays my way?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask him.”</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t. Everybody knows that,
and what we’ve been afraid of, now that Walter has
shown himself to be such a chump, was that you—that
if he didn’t quit—that some day you’d——”</p>

<p>“I’d what?” inquired Dan, aware of his friend’s
confusion.</p>

<p>“Oh, that you’d quit and call the whole thing
off,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Would you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I have thought of it,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“We all know that. But don’t you do it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“We’ll need you in the pitcher’s box, for one
thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Walter thought when he got his
father to take me up. You know Walter was behind
the whole thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t his fault or Gus Kiggins’ either if we
don’t know it,” said Ned angrily.</p>

<p>“What does Gus say?”</p>

<p>“You know what he says.”</p>

<p>“That I’m a charity patient.”</p>

<p>“Nobody pays any attention to what he says,
anyway,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that. Honestly, Ned, what
would you do if you were in my place?” asked
Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, though I know what I want you
to do.”</p>

<p>“Stay on?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And put up with what Gus Kiggins says and
does?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t count for much.”</p>

<p>“Then, with what Walter says?”</p>

<p>“That’s harder, I’ll own up; but——”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“What does Mr. Borden say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He hasn’t said a word.”</p>

<p>“Have you said anything to him?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Ned,” said Dan, turning about in
the seat and facing his companion, “I’ll tell you that
sometimes the whole affair is more than I can
stand. I didn’t ask to come. I had a little money
saved and I was going to the normal school. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
wish now I had and hadn’t taken a cent from Mr.
Borden. But he came to me and told me it was
all pure sentiment on my part that made me draw
back. He went on to say that he hadn’t any foolish
notions about such things, that in his business he
depended a good deal upon the things his friends
could throw his way, and that he never refused
any of them because of any such feelings as I pretended
to have. Then he told me that I could look
upon it as a pure matter of business. That Walter
was a spoiled boy and that it would be worth a
good deal more to him—I mean Mr. Borden—to
pay what my term bills would cost just to have me
room with Walter. Of course, I wanted to come,
and when he put it in that light I couldn’t find
any reason why I shouldn’t take up with his offer.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any reason!” exclaimed Ned
warmly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not—and yet as a business proposition,
look at it for a minute. It isn’t very modest of me
to say so, but Mr. Borden thought—or at least
he implied—that what influence I had over Walter
would pay what it might cost his father to have
me room with him. But look at it! You all say
that Walter is a ‘chump.’ He’s away down in his
classes and if I should suggest to him to do certain
things that would be the surest way of getting him
to do just the opposite. Walter doesn’t like me.
He chums with Gus Kiggins——”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t stick to anything very long, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
isn’t any reason for believing that Gus will be an
exception.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure of that. Gus seems to have
him under his thumb.”</p>

<p>“Get him out from under it.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Can’t some of us help?”</p>

<p>“How?” again inquired Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can have a talk with Walter, or we
can put it up to Gus.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Dan. “Perhaps a word with Walter
sometime, if it came in all right might be a good
thing, but I don’t want you to say anything to Gus.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It would make a bad matter worse. You see,
this is a part of my course, I guess. I’ve had to
learn a lot of things——”</p>

<p>“You’re learning them all right,” broke in Ned.
“You’re in the first division now, and can study in
your room——”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, some other things. I’ve had a lot to learn.
I’ve lived on a farm all my life, and there, you
know, they don’t always do things just as you fellows
do who have been brought up in the city.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot of it. You don’t understand because
you’ve always had them. But I’ve had to
keep my eyes open, and even then I find I’m doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
something that makes my cheeks burn. The first
night I was in the school Walter had to tell me to
put my butter on my butter-plate, not on——”</p>

<p>“The chump!” broke in Ned.</p>

<p>“No; he meant it all right. I guess I deserved
it and a good deal more. Perhaps if I learn these
little things now I sha’n’t have to learn them later
when it would be a good deal harder for me.”</p>

<p>“You make too much of such things.”</p>

<p>“Do I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do. Nobody thinks of them except
you.”</p>

<p>“They don’t have to.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right now, anyway, Dan.”</p>

<p>Dan smiled and did not reply, though the words of
his friend were far more comforting than Ned
could understand.</p>

<p>“There’s one way out of it,” continued Ned.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“You give Gus all that is coming to him. You
can do it! You——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Thrash him.”</p>

<p>Dan threw back his head and laughed. “What
good would that do?” he inquired. “Perhaps I
couldn’t do it. He’s about the best boxer in school.”</p>

<p>“I’d risk it.”</p>

<p>“That’s good of you,” said Dan dryly. “My
grandfather told me once that when he was a little
fellow his older brothers tried to get him to rob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
a bumblebee’s nest they’d found in the hay-field.
When he said he was afraid the bees would
sting him, the boys told him to go ahead, ‘They’d
risk it.’”</p>

<p>Ned laughed as he said, “And you think I’d be
willing to take the risk if you took on Gus?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“No, you didn’t; but you implied it. I’m not
afraid of Gus Kiggins.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking about him.”</p>

<p>“What are you afraid of then?”</p>

<p>“Myself. Suppose I should fight him, and then
suppose I did succeed in whipping him—and that’s
something I’m not a bit sure of—what would I
prove?”</p>

<p>“You’d put him where he belongs, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I told you I wasn’t thinking about him. I was
thinking of myself.”</p>

<p>“A fellow isn’t called upon to stand everything.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“And yet you say you won’t even defend yourself.”</p>

<p>“Did I say that?”</p>

<p>“That’s what you meant.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever you decide to do, promise me
you won’t do anything before you tell me.”</p>

<p>“I promise you as far as Walter and Mr. Borden
are concerned.”</p>

<p>“All right. That’s all I want. Hello, here we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
are at the Junction. Some of the fellows ought to
get on here. There are some of them,” Ned added
as he arose in his seat and peered from the window
of the car. “Here comes Gus Kiggins himself!”
he added hastily.</p>

<p>Several boys noisily entered the car, Gus leading
the crowd. As he caught sight of the four boys he
hastened down the aisle and, stopping in front of
Dan, looked insolently at him and then in his loudest
tones began to shout, “Co’ boss! Co’ boss! Co’
boss!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<small>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Above the noisy greetings of the boys the
sneering words of Gus Kiggins were plainly
heard. Instinctively the boys turned and looked
at Dan, but if he was aware of the taunt he did
not manifest his feelings, except that his face flushed
slightly.</p>

<p>“How did you find the hog business, Gus?” inquired
Ned angrily, as he faced the boisterous bully.</p>

<p>“You’ve said enough about that,” retorted Gus
hotly.</p>

<p>“Have I?” laughed Ned, quick to see the impression
he had made. “If I have I am glad of
it. It’s about the only way one can drive an idea
into some heads, you know.” Ned spoke quietly, but
his anger was evident to all the boys.</p>

<p>“At any rate I don’t carry the marks of my trade
around with me!” declared Gus. “I don’t wear
pigskin boots——”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to wear them,” broke in Ned
glibly.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows laughing at?” demanded
Gus fiercely, as he turned to face the boys, who
had broken into a shout at Ned’s words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t see anything funny in what Ned said.”</p>

<p>“That’s the funniest part of the whole thing,
Gus,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if I wanted to I could rake up
some things about every one of you that wouldn’t
sound very pretty.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” called Smith.</p>

<p>“Is that the reason why you called out as you
did when you came into the car?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“He looked the part. That’s why I said what I
did.”</p>

<p>“Every man does that more or less. My father
says he can tell a preacher before the man says a
word. So he can pick out a lawyer or a business
man before a word is spoken. I suppose a fellow
that comes from the country does carry around with
him a few of the marks of his trade the same as
everyone does, but if I lived where Dan does I
wouldn’t think of apologizing. I’d be proud of it.
Gus, does a man that makes his living sticking hogs
come to look like his trade the same as a preacher
or a lawyer or a business man?”</p>

<p>A shout of laughter caused Ned to look about
him in pretended astonishment. Gus Kiggins
settled back in his seat, his face glowering with
anger. But he soon became silent, as he well knew
that he was no match for Ned in such a contest.</p>

<p>“Queer about Gus,” said Ned to Dan after the
journey was resumed. “Last year he wasn’t so
bad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“What has changed him?” inquired Dan.</p>

<p>“I give it up. He seems to be almost insanely
jealous of you.”</p>

<p>“Of me?” Dan laughed a little bitterly as he
spoke. “I know, of course, that he hates me, but
I hadn’t thought of his being jealous. What have I
got to make him feel that way?”</p>

<p>“An arm,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“You mean my pitching arm?”</p>

<p>“Of course. You know, he had it all fixed, as he
thought, to be the pitcher on the nine this spring.”</p>

<p>“He may be yet,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed Ned warmly. “We’ve
got a fellow to occupy the box this spring who
could give points to the best pitcher in the country.”</p>

<p>“That’s what Si—he’s the harness-maker at
Rodman, you know—is all the time saying,” laughed
Dan, his good nature now having been restored.
“He wants to have the New Yorks come up to
play the nine at Rodman. He seems to think they’d
be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s not quite so bad as that,” said Ned
lightly. “But I know we’ve a mighty good pitcher
for the Tait School nine this spring. And don’t
you forget it, either! Don’t you go into any fool
business. Just grit your teeth and hang on. Everything
will come out all right this spring. Gus Kiggins’
jealousy is not very comfortable, but it never
killed anyone yet. He hasn’t got friends enough in
the school to elect him dishwasher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“Probably he doesn’t want that job,” said Dan
smilingly. “And yet there isn’t a finer-looking fellow
in school. Just look at his shoulders now.”</p>

<p>Ned glanced at Gus, who was seated in the end
of the car. “Yes, he’s got the shoulders and the
muscle. He’s all right until you get up to his head.
Last year he was a fairly decent fellow in spite of
his dirty work on the football team. This year
he cut out his low-down tricks, but he seems to be
letting it out in other ways.”</p>

<p>“The eleven did fairly well,” suggested Dan.</p>

<p>“Tied the Atlas High School for third place,”
laughed Ned. “We’ll say that the St. John’s School
really was lowest. They can’t deny it, either. But
when the baseball season opens, then just keep an
eye on the Tait School nine! The first game will
be an eye-opener! No one knows what a ‘find’ we
have in the pitcher’s box.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think the school league is a good
thing?”</p>

<p>“Fine! We weren’t in shape for football, that’s
all. We’ll make it up though when it comes to
baseball! Next year we’ll be all ready for hockey
and basket-ball. I think that we’ll be able to arrange
for a track meet this spring too. Ever do
anything on the track, Dan?”</p>

<p>“I never did.”</p>

<p>“You never tried, you mean,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>“I never tried, then. I guess I can ‘run’
though,” said Dan dryly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“I guess you can too, though not in the way you
mean. I don’t believe you know how to run away.
Don’t you ever learn, either. But when it comes to
running for something, that’s another story. I tell
you, Dan, there’s nothing like it! When a half-dozen
fellows are all bunched on the track and everyone
is putting out every ounce of strength he’s got
and the tape isn’t more than ten yards away and
the fellows are all yelling like mad and you can feel
that the sprinter from the High School or the Military
Academy is right on your heels, even when you
don’t, for the life of you, dare to look behind you—why,
I’m telling you, Dan Richards, there are
mighty few things in life to be compared with it!
I think I’m a fairly good sprinter. I can do the
hundred in ten-three. But I believe you can do
better than that. You’re just built for a runner.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you I could ‘run’?” asked Dan
dryly.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Ned lightly. “I know
what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you do,” said Dan soberly.
“I’m not at all sure that I do.”</p>

<p>“You just keep on sawing wood, that’s all you
have to do.”</p>

<p>“Or calling ‘co, boss,’” said Dan a little bitterly
as he saw Gus Kiggins rise from his seat.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it. That pork chop isn’t worth
wasting your time on! Just leave him alone.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, if he will leave me alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“He will,” said Ned positively. “We’ll attend
to him.”</p>

<p>Whether or not it was due to the “attentions”
of Ned and his friends, Dan was as pleased as he
was surprised, as the days of the winter term
passed, to find that Gus Kiggins seemed to avoid
him. He seldom came to the room of Dan and
Walter; and as for Walter, although he still was
much in Gus’s company, he did not often have much
to say to his roommate. Much as Dan would have
liked to enter into Walter’s life more fully, he was
too proud to betray his chagrin at the change which
had now apparently become fixed in their relations.
The old friendly feeling was gone and in its place
had come a relation which simply made Walter
apparently tolerate the presence in his rooms of the
boy for whose coming he had been chiefly responsible.</p>

<p>The monotony of the routine of the winter term
was broken in March by a visit from Mr. Borden.
Dan, who had not been informed by Walter of
the expected visit, was surprised one afternoon
when he entered his room to find Mr. Borden seated
there. His first thought was that Walter had sent
for his father and a feeling of anger arose in Dan’s
heart. Why had he himself not written before his
roommate could complain? Perhaps Mr. Borden
had come for the purpose of explaining that his
promise was now void.</p>

<p>The greeting which Walter’s father gave him was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
so quietly cordial that Dan was perplexed. He was
not able entirely to conceal his embarrassment even
when Mr. Borden bade him to be seated. “When
did you come, Mr. Borden?” Dan inquired.</p>

<p>“I arrived this morning,” replied the visitor
quietly.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Walter?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” Mr. Borden smiled as he saw Dan’s
expression of surprise. “I had a few things to
attend to first before I could give any time to Walter
or you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go out and find him for you,” said Dan,
hastily rising as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Not quite yet, Dan. There are some things
I want to say to you when Walter is not here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Dan’s face flushed and his confusion
was manifest.</p>

<p>“Do you know where Walter is now?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any idea?”</p>

<p>“Probably he is with some of the boys. I’ll be
glad to look him up if you would like to have me.”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Mr. Borden quietly. “If you
were to look him up for me, where would you go
first to find him?”</p>

<p>“Why, in some one of the fellows’ rooms,”
replied Dan, looking quickly at his visitor as he
spoke. How much and what did Mr. Borden know?</p>

<p>“Would you go first to Gus Kiggins’ room?”</p>

<p>“Why, I might,” replied Dan lamely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“I thought so. Dan, have you had any ‘marks’
against you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve had ten.”</p>

<p>“Been put on the ‘limits’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Dan, his face flushing
scarlet.</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me what for? Please do
not think I am too inquisitive, but I should like to
know the reasons.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Sharp said I was scuffling in the hall. That
is against the rules, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. If there is a rule against scuffling
why did you break it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t intend to break it, but I suppose I
did,” said Dan lamely.</p>

<p>“Why?” persisted Mr. Borden.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any answer.”</p>

<p>“Would you put Gus Kiggins out of your room
if the same thing happened again?”</p>

<p>Dan glanced quickly at Mr. Borden, but the face
of his visitor did not betray any feeling. “I don’t
know,” he said at last in a low voice.</p>

<p>“In which division of the class are you, Dan?”
Mr. Borden next inquired.</p>

<p>“The first.”</p>

<p>“That’s the first quarter of the class, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is Walter in that division?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is—that is, he isn’t this term—I
mean——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“Will he be there next term?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect him to be?”</p>

<p>“He could be—he might. He has a quicker mind
than I have.”</p>

<p>Still Mr. Borden’s face did not betray his real
feelings. “Dan,” he said abruptly, “why didn’t
you write me?”</p>

<p>“About what, Mr. Borden?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you write me that letter you
began?”</p>

<p>“How do you know I began a letter?” asked
Dan in amazement.</p>

<p>“You began a letter to me in which you thanked
me for what I had done for you, but you went on to
say that you could not stay in the Tait School any
longer.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked the astounded Dan
with crimson face.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Dan, how I know. Let me answer
your unwritten letter by word of mouth. A bargain
is a bargain and you have no right to go back upon
it any more than I have.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Borden,” protested Dan, “that wasn’t
it. I didn’t feel that—I thought I couldn’t keep on—I
didn’t want you to think——”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” said Mr. Borden as Dan’s confusion
became still more manifest. “I understand
how you feel. You thought you were accepting
favors. You thought I believed that if you roomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
with Walter he would do better work. He hasn’t
done better work and you thought you were not living
up to your part. I sincerely trust that Walter
has not been such a ‘cad’ as to make you feel in
any way that you were under obligations to him or
me.”</p>

<p>As Dan was silent, Mr. Borden went on. “Let
me say right here, Dan, that I am more than satisfied
with my part. I know Walter and I think I
know you. If at any time you want to leave him
and room with some other boy, I shall not object. I
don’t believe there is a better investment than putting
money into men. If I could only buy for
Walter what he needs I should not stop at the expense.
And, Dan, there’s another point.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think it is a better, a truer test of a
real man to receive than it is to give. It’s harder
sometimes too. But I’m talking with you about our
bargain. I want you to stick to it. You will, I
know. Ah, here comes Walter,” Mr. Borden added
hastily as his boy entered the room.</p>

<p>Dan at once departed and for an hour sat in the
library holding a book but not reading a word. An
hour later he returned to his room. As he entered
he saw that Walter was alone, but his roommate
sprang to his feet and his face was livid with anger
as he faced Dan.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“You liar! You mucker! You low-down telltale!”
shouted Walter, looking straight into
the face of his roommate. “I might have known
you’d spy on me. That’s what all the fellows said
you’d do! And now you’ve done it!”</p>

<p>Dan rose as Walter’s tirade continued. For a
moment he looked steadily at the angry boy and,
though his face was colorless, without a word he
started toward the door.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” shouted Walter, springing in front
of Dan and closing the door. “You don’t crawl
out that way! I’d like to know what you have to
say for yourself. We’ll have this out right now
while we’re at it. I’d like to know what you have
to say for yourself!”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About what I’ve just said.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“‘Explain’; ‘Explain’!” retorted Walter. “I
‘explain’! You’re the one, I guess, to do the explaining.
Gus Kiggins says you can make a pet
of a toad, but a toad will still be a toad to the end
of the chapter, and I guess he’s about right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>“How about a hog, Walter?” The sneering
query escaped Dan’s lips before he was fairly aware
of what he had said. Deeply as he regretted his
momentary failure to control his tongue he was
aware that his provocation was great and that he
had been most unjustly accused.</p>

<p>“Who are you to talk about hogs?” demanded
Walter.</p>

<p>“I know a little about them. We raised a few
on the farm. They are interesting animals, Walter,
if you go at them in the right way.”</p>

<p>“That hasn’t anything to do with this matter.
What I want to know is why you told my father.”</p>

<p>“Told him what?”</p>

<p>“About me.”</p>

<p>“What did I tell him about you?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want to know.”</p>

<p>“Did he say that I told him anything?”</p>

<p>“Of course he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“He knew a lot of things that he couldn’t have
found out unless you told him.”</p>

<p>“Who said so? Did Gus Kiggins?”</p>

<p>“I guess I know that without any of the fellows
having to tell me.”</p>

<p>“What did your father know?”</p>

<p>“He knew a lot of things. He told me that if I
didn’t do better he would be compelled to take me
out of school. He said he’d put me to work in the
shops!” The expression of disgust that appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
on Walter’s face as he referred to the “shops” in
his father’s factory might have made Dan laugh at
another time, but he felt no such inclination now.
The matter was too serious.</p>

<p>“Look here, Walter!” said Dan. “Do you
mean to tell me that you honestly believe I reported
you to your father?”</p>

<p>“That’s the only way he could have found out
some things.”</p>

<p>“Let me ask you a question. Do you know when
your father came here?”</p>

<p>“Why, this afternoon, I suppose,” replied Walter
in surprise.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He came on the eight-thirty train this
morning.”</p>

<p>“He did? Where was he all the forenoon?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t tell me. Couldn’t you
guess?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Walter slowly.
“When did you first see him?”</p>

<p>“When I came into our room after the Latin
hour.”</p>

<p>“That was only a few minutes before I came,”
replied Walter, feeling relieved.</p>

<p>“Yes. As far as I recall, Walter, he asked me
only one question.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“He asked my opinion about Gus Kiggins.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?” inquired Walter, looking
anxiously into his roommate’s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing that amounted to anything. I didn’t
have to, even if I had wanted to, for he knew pretty
much all about him. I would have just as good a
right, Walter, to say that you told him about me as
you have to say that I told, for he asked me about
those ten marks Mr. Sharp gave me and he knew
too, that I’d been on the ‘limits.’ Did you tell him,
Walter?”</p>

<p>“Of course I didn’t. You know that as well as
I do.” Walter’s voice was different now and there
were traces of a smile about the corners of his
mouth.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you didn’t,” said Dan warmly.</p>

<p>“The ‘old boy’ is nobody’s fool——”</p>

<p>“The who?” interrupted Dan sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, my father, if that’s what you want me to
say.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Walter, I haven’t any father. When
I see some of you fellows with yours, do you know
there’s nothing in all the world that I want deep
down in my heart as I do what you’ve got and I
haven’t. But if I did have one, and he was a man as
true and interested as your father is and did as
much for me as your father does for you, it doesn’t
seem to me that I’d speak disrespectfully of him
or let any other fellow do it, either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right,” said Walter flippantly. “He
means to do the right thing. I understand that as
well as you do. The greatest trouble is that he
doesn’t just understand a fellow——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe a part of the trouble, Walter, is because
he does understand. Ever thought of that?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t the way of it. My mother does.”
Dan smiled as he recalled the weak and somewhat
vain little woman who thought she was manifesting
a greater love for her boy because she upheld and
defended him right or wrong. “Of course I know,”
resumed Walter, “that my father is a mighty smart
man. It takes a cool hand to get ahead of him.
He’s the best business man in his line. Why, Dan,
he’s built up the business his father left him till
now he has just four times as many men in the
shops as he had when he began. When you say
that he had been here all the morning, why, that
puts things in a different light. He probably ‘got
busy.’ Understand, Dan, that I didn’t really mean
to accuse you of going to him with stories about me,
though you’ll have to own up that it did look a
bit suspicious when I found him alone with you
and that he knew all about me.”</p>

<small>A PLOT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Did you suspect me before Gus Kiggins told
you to?”</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Dan Richards, you’re making
a fool of yourself! Don’t you suppose I ever have
an idea of my own?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You don’t act as if you did. Look here, Dan,
what’s the trouble between you and Gus, anyway?
Are you jealous of him?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge,” replied Dan with a
smile.</p>

<p>“He thinks you are.”</p>

<p>“You can put his mind at ease on that score.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it? Are you afraid of him?”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve found it.”</p>

<p>“You are? He thinks you are, but I never would
have believed it of you.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“He is a powerful brute.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“And he’s the best boxer in the school.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve heard,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I blame you,” laughed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Walter. “He isn’t exactly the kind of a chap I’d
like to run up against on a dark street when I was
all alone.”</p>

<p>“I’m more afraid of him in the daytime when
he’s with others.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Walter
sharply.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Walter,” said Dan earnestly. “I
don’t mean to preach to you. I know I’m only a
countryman and you’ve had lots of chances that I
haven’t. But if I had as clear and quick a mind as
you have and then had such chances to develop
it as you have here in this school, do you know what
I’d do?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’d buckle down to work.”</p>

<p>“I certainly should.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know everything, Dan,” said Walter,
his pleasure at his roommate’s words arousing his
good nature, as unstinted praise never failed to do.
“I hate the stuff we’re getting here. Latin and
algebra and physics! Bah! They make me sick.
What good are they anyway? We’ll never use
them again after we get out of this old trap.”</p>

<p>“Walter, did you ever see a fireman shoveling
coal under the boiler of a locomotive?”</p>

<p>“Occasionally,” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he does it for?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for about sixty or seventy dollars a month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“Well, even if that is so, why does the company
pay him that to do that work?”</p>

<p>“To heat up the boiler and get up steam.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. He doesn’t shovel that coal to get
more coal or because he expects to use that coal
again, does he?”</p>

<p>“What are you driving at anyway?”</p>

<p>“I may be all wrong, but my idea is something
like this—just as a fireman shovels the coal, not to
get more coal but to get steam, so I think the work
here is not to get things we’ll use again, but to get
or do things that will give us——”</p>

<p>“Steam?” broke in Walter with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! That’s it exactly. I’ve a funny idea
that when a fellow shirks or dodges his work he’s
really the fellow to suffer. He doesn’t cheat the
teacher half so much as he cheats himself. He’s
just subtracting that much power from himself,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Dan, you’re a funny chap.”</p>

<p>“I know it, but I don’t believe I’m half so
‘funny’ as the fellow is who throws away such
chances as he has here in the Tait School.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if you were right. I
wish I were like you, Dan. It’s easy for some fellows.
But then you’ve got everything to get and
I’ve got everything without any getting. My pater
has more money than he knows what to do with;
he’s got a big business and I’ll have a share in that
by and by——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“If you’re strong enough and able to hold it,”
broke in Dan.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of that. I’ll give you a job some
day, maybe, but I know it would please the old
folks at home if I should take hold; I’m half inclined
to try it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact that Walter was only “half”
inclined was the explanation of the fact that his
good resolution lasted only a few weeks. For a
time he did try, but his will was weak and he was
so far behind in his studies that the work was
doubly hard. In the end he relapsed into his old
ways and spent more and more time with Gus
Kiggins, while the renewed good-fellowship between
the two roommates, which to Dan’s delight had
been in evidence, was soon broken. Walter became
more irritable and his feeling for Dan apparently
was one of increasing dislike.</p>

<p>But the days of the winter term passed rapidly
and when spring arrived the prospects of the nine
and the position it would secure in the new league
became the absorbing matter of interest. Dan did
his utmost to avoid meeting Gus Kiggins and was
rejoiced as the days passed to find that apparently
the effort was mutual. The two boys seldom met
except on the diamond and there was no dispute
as to Dan’s right to occupy the pitcher’s box. The
players, the coach, and indeed the entire school, all
were agreed, and great things were expected from
Dan’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Gus Kiggins doggedly continued to
practise pitching and his work was of such a character
that he was looked upon as the substitute
pitcher in addition to his work on first base, where
he was acknowledged to be supreme.</p>

<p>Little Carlton Hall had learned a few lessons
not taught in the classroom and somehow had
weathered the storms, although he still was not
without his attentions from Gus Kiggins and others.
His deep affection for Dan had increased steadily,
and it was Dan who had strengthened the younger
boy’s spirit of self-reliance and determination so
that at last he had decided to remain in school,
though his life there was not one of unalloyed
pleasure.</p>

<p>The first game of the league was now at hand.
The nine of the Military Academy and their supporters
were to come the following day, and excitement
ran high in the Tait School. Dan, in spite of
his quiet manner, was perhaps more excited than
any of his fellows, realizing as he did how much
success or failure would mean to him.</p>

<p>The afternoon before the game Ned was surprised
when Carlton Hall came to his room.
“What’s wrong, young man?” Ned demanded as
he became aware of the excitement of his visitor.</p>

<p>At the boy’s reply Ned was as much aroused
as his caller, and seizing Carlton by the shoulders
he demanded: “How do you know? Say that
again! Be careful now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“It’s just as I told you,” said Carlton.</p>

<p>“Say it again,” demanded Ned sharply.</p>

<p>“I was feeling lonesome,” began Carlton obediently,
“and I wanted to be alone. I went over to
those bushes back of the library and just stretched
myself on the ground there behind them. While I
was lying there Gus Kiggins and Walter Borden
came along and sat down on that bench the other
side of the lilac bushes.”</p>

<p>“How did you know who it was?”</p>

<p>“I peeked. I was just going to try to crawl
away without being seen when I heard Gus say,
‘We’ll fix the pious fraud.’”</p>

<p>“Go on. What did Walter say?”</p>

<p>“He said, ‘I hate to do it, Gus.’”</p>

<p>“Did Gus say what he wanted Walter to do?”</p>

<p>“You’re right he did.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“He wanted Walter to put some stuff in the
water Dan drank or in something he ate before the
game to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What did he want him to put in it?”</p>

<p>“Ipecac. Gus said, ‘That’ll make him sick
enough to quit the box and it won’t hurt him a bit,
either.’”</p>

<p>“What did Walter say then?”</p>

<p>“He said he didn’t want to do it. He said he
didn’t like Dan any better than Gus did, but he
didn’t want to go into any such low-down trick as
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>“I should think he wouldn’t want to,” said Ned
savagely. “But he agreed in the end that he’d
do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think Gus knew something that Walter
was afraid he’d tell if he didn’t agree.”</p>

<p>“The sneak! Did you hear either of them say
when the trick was to be played?”</p>

<p>“Some time just before the game.”</p>

<p>“How long did you lie there?”</p>

<p>“All the time they were talking. I wanted to
get away, but I didn’t dare move. If Gus Kiggins
had found me he would have killed me,” said
Carlton, shuddering as he spoke.</p>

<p>“What did you do then?”</p>

<p>“I waited till they went away and then I put for
your room as fast as my legs could carry me.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything more?”</p>

<p>“That was all they talked about. Gus said if
Walter would get Dan out of the pitcher’s box, then
he would see to it that he—I mean Walter—was
elected captain of the nine for next year.”</p>

<p>“They’re a noble pair!” exclaimed Ned in disgust.
“You’re sure you haven’t lisped a word of
this to anyone?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t. Don’t let a whisper of it get out.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Carlton. “But you’ll see
that nothing happens to Dan, won’t you?” he added
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Rest your infantile soul on that!” said Ned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
angrily. “Now, you’d better go. I shouldn’t want
Gus to find you here. If he should ever hear that
you have told me what you have, what do you suppose
would happen to you?”</p>

<p>“Gus would——” The lad stopped with a
shudder.</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” said Ned sternly. “You
mustn’t let a word of this get out—not a word!
Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Carlton; “but I don’t want anything
to happen to Dan——”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you there wouldn’t?” broke in
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I’m afraid. My! if Dan couldn’t pitch
to-morrow and the Military Academy should beat
us——”</p>

<p>“Go home and lock yourself in your room, for
fear you’ll let out something about this! I’ll look
after it. Don’t you be afraid! If you’ve told me
the truth——”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you just what I heard Gus say,” broke
in the little fellow.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Carlton,” said Ned soothingly,
as he saw the fear expressed on the face of his
small visitor. “I’m glad you came straight to me.
I’ll look after it. Now, run along like a good little
boy.”</p>

<p>“I’m going,” said Carlton, turning toward the
door. Then facing Ned, he said tremblingly, “If
Gus should find out that I’d told you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“He won’t!”</p>

<p>“But if he should?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared. We’ll attend to Gus at the
proper time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it won’t be till after he has killed me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you give up the ghost till you have to,”
said Ned to his frightened visitor. “Good night,
Carlton. Don’t forget to root your prettiest to-morrow
when Dan strikes out the heavy hitters of
the Military Academy. We may need every voice;”
and Ned immediately sought Dan, whom he found
alone in his room. “How are you, Dan?” he
inquired as he seated himself in an easy chair
and looked keenly at his friend. “Feeling fit for
the game to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“My pedal extremities are a trifle chilly,” said
Dan good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I’ll risk them. That isn’t what I’m afraid of.”</p>

<p>“What has frightened you? The nine of the
Military Academy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid for you, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of me? Well, I don’t know that I blame
you. I’m almost afraid myself——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I was afraid of you, Dan. I said
I was afraid for you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just heard of the dirtiest trick ever conceived
by mortal man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Dan quietly, as he looked
steadily into Ned’s face.</p>

<p>“It’s a trick to put you out of the game.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a scheme to feed you on ipecac just before
the game begins.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t swallow it I sha’n’t have any trouble,
shall I?”</p>

<p>“No. But——”</p>

<p>“Who is to do the trick?”</p>

<p>“You can guess who is behind it. It’s the lowest,
meanest thing I ever heard of! If I really believed
it all, I’d——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it?” broke in Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what to think. I confess I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me just what it is that scares
you.”</p>

<p>Thus bidden, Ned, without mentioning any names,
related what Carlton had reported to him. “What
do you think, Dan?” he asked, when he had completed
his story.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s a fellow in the school
who would be guilty of such a low trick!” said
Dan positively. “I guess it’s a false alarm. We’re
all nervous over the game.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s so,” said Ned, his countenance
brightening a little. “Still, it’s better to be on the
safe side,” he added cautiously.</p>

<p>“What can be done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“You can be on your guard anyway.”</p>

<p>“I might not eat or drink anything,” suggested
Dan with a smile. “Then I’d be safe anyway.”</p>

<p>“And be in no condition for the game. No; I’ll
tell you what we’ll do, Dan.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll stick together after luncheon
till the game is called.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be much of a hardship,” said Dan
lightly.</p>

<p>“No; but if both of us are on the lookout it
won’t be likely that anything can be done.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m agreed, though I haven’t a bit
of fear.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you haven’t; I wish I were all clear in
my mind too. But I’m not. We’ll keep both eyes
open, Dan. Hello!” he added; “here comes Walter
and Smith and Gus Kiggins.”</p>

<p>The three boys entered the room and at once the
subject of the game on the following day became
the topic of conversation. To Dan’s surprise, both
Walter and Gus appeared to be unusually friendly.
Apparently all the feeling of jealousy which the
latter openly had manifested toward Dan was gone
and Walter glowingly predicted at least twelve
strike-outs for his roommate.</p>

<p>“Of course we want to win this game,” Walter
said glibly. “If we can get those fellows scared,
we’ll have an advantage in the other five league
games we’ll have to play. Still, ‘one swallow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
doesn’t make a summer,’ and we’ll not cry if this
game goes against us.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to lose this game if every
fellow backs up Dan,” said Ned quietly.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’re going to do,” declared
Smith.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” said Gus. “If every fellow
doesn’t do his level best, then we’ll know the reason
why. I guess Samson has given it to the nine
straight. He says he’s just a little afraid some one
of us may put himself out of condition by eating or
drinking something that won’t agree with him. I
never saw Samson so nervous as he is over this
game. Next year he’ll get his training table. He
says the doctor has at last agreed. I think it will
be a fine thing myself.”</p>

<p>Dan glanced quietly at Ned while Gus was speaking
and saw an expression on his face that caused
the young pitcher to rise and say, “Well, it’s time
for me to go to bed. You fellows can go right
on with your talk, but a good long sleep does more
for me than all your patent methods put together.”</p>

<p>“There goes the warning bell anyway,” said
Smith, as the chapel-bell rang out. “We’ll all try
Dan’s cure for nerves.” And the visitors at once
departed from the room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If Dan, in his heart, believed any reliance was
to be placed on what Ned had said to him concerning
the plot, he did not betray his fear in any way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>There was an air of only partly subdued excitement
in the school the following morning, but
if Dan was watchful not even Ned was aware of
his friend’s caution. The game was to be called
at three o’clock. At luncheon-time Ned stopped at
Dan’s room and the two boys went together to the
dining-hall.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Ned lightly, “I’m sticking to you
like a brother. I don’t intend to let you get out of
my sight one second between now and the game. I
hope you’ll appreciate my oversight.”</p>

<p>“Glad to have you, though you’ll have your
trouble for your pains,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was all that Ned said in response.</p>

<p>The excitement of the morning was more manifest
as the boys entered the dining-room. There
were many glances of curiosity at the long table
where the boys from the Military Academy were
seated as the guests of the Tait School.</p>

<p>“A fine-looking team,” said Gus Kiggins, as he
seated himself beside Walter, whose place at the
table was next to Dan’s. Opposite them sat Ned
and Smith and Hodge.</p>

<p>“They’ll make us know we’ve been playing a
game before we’re done,” said Hodge in response
to the statement of Gus.</p>

<p>“You’re right they will,” joined in Smith. “Dan,
we’re all looking to you to uphold the honor of
the school,” he added, as he looked across the table
at the school pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, say something nice to Dan,” growled Walter.
“He’s got troubles enough of his own without
rubbing it in. What’s the matter, Dan?” he
added; “you look pale. Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” replied Dan with a smile. “I
never went into a game feeling better in my life. If
I don’t do all that you want me to I sha’n’t be able
to charge it up to the way I feel.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” growled Gus without
looking up. “Say, fellows,” he added, “I’ve
ordered some apollinaris lemonade for the nine.
Samson won’t let us drink any water during the
game, you know.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Gus!” exclaimed Hodge. “I
hope you’ll make an extra home run to-day.”</p>

<p>The glasses were placed beside the plates, and as
Ned looked keenly at Dan he shook his head slightly.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, fellows,” said Smith, “I’m
never superstitious except before a ball game. Let’s
all change glasses for luck.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” joined in Ned with a sudden
eagerness. “We’ll all exchange. Here, Smith, you
give yours to Hodge, I’ll give you mine, and I’ll
take Hodge’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s all nonsense,” exclaimed Gus abruptly.</p>

<p>“‘A little nonsense now and then is relished by
the best of men,’” spoke up Ned. “Try it, fellows.
Can’t do any harm anyway.”</p>

<p>Dan laughingly had exchanged his glass for Walter’s,
though the latter was not aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
exchange, as at that moment he was looking back at
the table where the opposing nine was seated.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” said Ned, who had
seen the exchange, which had been unnoticed by the
others.</p>

<p>In a brief time the boys arose and passed out of
the hall.</p>

<p>“Be down at the dressing-room at two sharp,”
he called as the boys separated after they had left
the building.</p>

<p class="cap">Dan and Ned proceeded directly to the dressing-room,
the former somewhat downcast
and the latter more lively even than he was wont
to be. “How do you feel?” he laughingly inquired
of his friend as the two boys entered the room.</p>

<p>“I have felt better,” replied Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? Are your pedal extremities
chilly?”</p>

<p>“I have not noticed anything of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Afraid?”</p>

<p>“Not of the Military Academy nine, if that’s what
you mean.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Where is Walter?” Dan abruptly asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him since we left the dining-hall,”
replied Ned, glancing keenly at his friend as
he spoke. “He’ll be here all right. You don’t need
to worry about Walter, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Ned, do you think there was anything
in that change of glasses? I’ll own up that I’ve——”</p>

<p>“Anything in the lemonade?” broke in Ned
hastily.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess I do,” acknowledged Ned. “Of all
the vile tricks I ever heard of, that is the worst;
that is, if there really was anything in what Gus
was doing. It doesn’t seem possible that he or
Walter could stoop to——”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for Walter,” interrupted Dan. “I’ll
know when he comes. If he had a hand in
that——”</p>

<p>“What if he did? That’s just one more reason
for showing the fellows to-day that you can’t be
put out of the game that way.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that.”</p>

<p>“Then, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t make myself believe that Walter Borden
would stoop to such a low-down trick. Why, only
last summer he was one of the best fellows I ever
saw. He was generous; he’d give away his last
cent——”</p>

<p>“If it didn’t cost him anything to do it.”</p>

<p>“All the boys liked him. He was just a little
bit cocksure that he could give us all points on the
game, but he was straight and true as steel—at
least I thought he was.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s all right yet. That was a slick thing
you did.”</p>

<p>“What did I do?”</p>

<p>“When you changed your glass for his.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry now that I did that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you should be. If he’s sick, it’s
his own fault. If he can’t play on the nine to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
I’ll put Sam Ventnor at short. He’s almost as good
as Walter anyway. If Walter could play short just
half as well as he thinks he can he’d get the fielding
average of the league.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d come,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. If he doesn’t come it will be because
he has been studying harder than he ever has
in his life before.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, all I mean is that if he is taking a dose
of his own medicine he will be the better off for it.
If he isn’t taking it, then you’ve nothing to worry
about as far as I can see.”</p>

<p>The dressing-room was well filled now, and it
became difficult to carry on conversation. The excited
boys were all striving to appear indifferent, but
their attempts were not altogether successful.
Neither Gus nor Walter had come and their absence
was beginning to be noticed.</p>

<p>“What has become of Gus and Walter?” inquired
Hodge as he drew on his shoes. “I never
knew either of them to be late at a game.”</p>

<p>“They’ll show up,” said Smith.</p>

<p>“Or down,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?” asked Smith lightly.
“It’s all one to me.”</p>

<p>“There’s a big difference.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you should go into a hotel and
ask the clerk for the price of rooms——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve done that many a time. I was in the Gorton
last Easter vacation——”</p>

<p>“What did he tell you?”</p>

<p>“Who—the clerk? He said they had rooms
from two dollars up.”</p>

<p>“Well, now suppose he had said, after he’d
looked you over, that in your case the price of
rooms would be two down. Would that make any
difference, Smith?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Smith. “I think it would. But
I don’t see——”</p>

<p>“Here comes Gus Kiggins!” broke in one of
the nine. “Walter is his shadow, and he can’t be
very far away. Hello, Gus!” he added. “What
made you late? Where’s Walter?”</p>

<p>“He’s sick,” replied Gus gruffly as he began to
don his suit.</p>

<p>“Sick!” exclaimed Hodge, as he and the other
members of the nine crowded about Gus. “What’s
the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“Ask somebody who knows!” retorted Gus, as
he looked angrily at Dan. “I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he be able to play?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s more than I know. There wasn’t anybody
to stand by him, so I stayed with him in
his room till just now. He has been vomiting and
he’s lying on his bed now. His face is as white as
chalk.” Gus glared at Dan while he was speaking,
until the others also turned and looked questioningly
at the young pitcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Did Dan make him sick?”</p>

<p>“Ask him. He can tell you better than I can,”
growled Gus.</p>

<p>“Dan, did you do anything to him?” Ned asked
quizzically as he turned to his friend.</p>

<p>“What could I do?” replied Dan, his face betraying
his trouble.</p>

<p>“Did you send for a doctor?” asked Hodge of
Gus.</p>

<p>“No. Walter wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“He said he’d be all right in a little while.”</p>

<p>“Probably something he ate,” suggested Hodge.</p>

<p>“Or drank,” said Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” demanded Gus,
turning sharply to Ned.</p>

<p>“If you don’t know, I can’t explain. Come on,
Dan,” he added, turning to the pitcher. “Come on;
we’ll run up to the room and take a look at the
poor chap.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back by the time the rest of you are
on the field. If we aren’t, Samson will bat flies
for you.”</p>

<p>Abruptly departing from the dressing-room, Dan
and Ned ran to the dormitory and in a brief time
entered Walter’s room. They found him standing
beside the table and his pale face and general appearance
at once betrayed his suffering.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Walter?” inquired Ned.
“Are you sick?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>“Awfully,” groaned Walter.</p>

<p>“Had the doctor?” continued Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any doctor.”</p>

<p>“If you’re sick you ought to have one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be all right in a little while. I’ll get into the
game too, before it’s ended!” he added savagely.
“You can’t put me out in any such way as this!”
The angry boy was looking directly at Dan as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“You act as if you thought Dan was to blame,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, what if I do?” demanded Walter testily.
“He knows whether or not he had anything to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we all know that without asking
Dan,” said Ned quietly. “We’ll have to start the
game, Walter, without you. If you feel better a
little later——”</p>

<p>“Who’s going to play short?” broke in Walter.</p>

<p>“I’ll put Sam Ventnor in for a while.”</p>

<p>“It’s just a part of a trick to shut me out,” declared
Walter fiercely.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what will be good for you,”
interrupted Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say it?” asked Walter sharply
as Ned waited.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought of trying ipecac?”</p>

<p>“Have I what?” Walter was staring at Ned,
and to the two boys it almost seemed that his pallor
deepened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Have you thought of trying ipecac?” repeated
Ned soberly. “It’s said to be good for some things
as well as for others.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Think it over and perhaps you’ll find out. If
you don’t, ask Gus Kiggins. He may be able to help
you find out. If you feel better, Walter, come down
to the field.”</p>

<p>“Walter,” inquired Dan, who had been silent
throughout the conversation, “don’t you want me to
stay here with you?”</p>

<p>“And not pitch?” demanded Ned, aghast, as he
turned to his friend.</p>

<p>“I guess Walter will be all right by the time I’m
needed.”</p>

<p>“No! I don’t want you here!” almost shouted
Walter. “I wish you never had been here! You’ve
made trouble ever since you entered. I was a
fool——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say ‘was,’ say ‘am,’” broke in Ned
sharply. “That’s a fine way to talk! You know
what is the matter with you just as well as I do.
And Gus Kiggins came down to the dressing-room
talking in his charming way about somebody that
had made you sick. Well, I guess somebody did
give you a dose! It would have done you more
good if he had doubled it. And you thought it was
for Dan! Sometime, maybe, you’ll know enough to
know that the cat which a monkey uses to pull his
chestnuts out of the fire gets his paws burned. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
would serve you right if I told the whole school
about the dirty trick you and Gus planned to
play on Dan. Now that you have a dose of your
own medicine, you sit up here and whine and cry
like a spanked baby.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Ned, it’s time for the game,” broke
in Dan as he grasped his friend by the arm. “Walter,”
he added, “you heard what Ned said, that
if you feel up to the mark a little later, you are to
come on down and he’ll put you into the game.
Come on, Ned!”</p>

<p>Almost reluctantly Ned turned and without another
word departed from the room. At the door
Dan glanced back at Walter who, speechless, was
staring at his departing visitors. Aware that Ned
was almost beside himself with rage, Dan led the
way hastily down the stairs. As the boys turned
toward the athletic field, Dan said: “Now, Ned,
you are in no condition to say anything. Don’t say
a word about this to the boys.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Ned fiercely. “It’s the
worst thing I ever heard of!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word about it.”</p>

<p>“I shall! I’ll let the whole school know——”</p>

<p>“Not if I am to pitch,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<small>THE LEAGUE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">For a moment Ned stared blankly at his companion,
and then said: “Dan, you certainly
beat anything I ever saw or heard of. I don’t know
which is the bigger fool, you or——”</p>

<p>“Is it a bargain?” broke in Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Of course it is, if you say so. There isn’t anything
else to be said.”</p>

<p>“All right then. Now forget all about it, Ned.
We’ll just go in to put the Military Academy nine
where it belongs. You’re sure of the signals?”</p>

<p>“I can put you easy on that score.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Just look at the crowd,” Dan added
as the two boys obtained their first view of the
assembly. “I never played before a crowd like
that!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mind?” asked Ned a little anxiously.</p>

<p>“I can tell you more about that a little later,” replied
Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“Go right in and begin to warm up. We haven’t
much time to spare.”</p>

<p>Both boys at once went upon the field—Ned to
make certain that his players were ready, while
Dan ran to one side of the diamond, where he began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
to pitch easily to Smith, who, for the time, was
receiving the ball.</p>

<p>As Dan occasionally glanced at the spectators, he
saw that almost numberless carriages and automobiles
were in line on both sides. In front of
them were men and boys close to the ropes. The
seats in the grand stand were a solid mass of color.
Indeed, seldom had the athletic field of the Tait
School presented such a gay appearance as that
which now greeted his eyes. If Dan was fearful,
his manner did not betray his feeling; and when,
after a brief delay, the umpires took their places and
the Tait School nine, in accordance with the arrangement
that the home team was to have the last inning,
advanced to their positions in the field, no one
apparently was more unconcerned than he. Sam
Ventnor was short-stop in Walter’s place. Gus
Kiggins loomed large at first base, Ned was behind
the bat, Hodge at third base, and Smith was in left
field. The ball was being swiftly thrown from one
baseman to another, but the eyes of the visitors
were all centered upon Dan as he slowly advanced
to the pitcher’s box. The umpire signaled for the
ball to be thrown him and as soon as he received
it he slipped it into his pocket, tossed a new ball
to Dan, and called sharply, “Play ball!”</p>

<p>The first game of the series in the new league was
begun.</p>

<p>“Ball!” called the umpire as Dan sent the first
ball swiftly to the outstretched hands of Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“Two balls!” was the announcement which followed
the young pitcher’s second attempt.</p>

<p>“Three balls!” was the third call of the umpire,
and a scattered cheer arose from the followers of
the Military Academy nine.</p>

<p>“Steady, Dan,” called Hodge from third base.</p>

<p>The pitcher slowly turned and glanced at the
field. He saw that his companions were all somewhat
nervous and there was a smile, whose meaning
was plain, on the face of Gus Kiggins. If Dan
shared in the prevailing feeling he did not manifest
it by his actions. Deliberately he studied the batter,
then drew back his arm and swiftly sent in the ball.
Whether the speed of the little sphere or its puzzling
curve misled the player or not Dan did not know,
but it struck the batter full in the shoulder.</p>

<p>A shout arose from the spectators as the player,
rubbing the wounded spot, started toward first base.
“Up in the air!” “Got him going!” “Wild as a
hawk!” were among the gleeful calls from the
friends of the Military Academy. An expression
of anxiety appeared on the faces of the supporters
and even on those of the members of the nine of the
Tait School. Dan, however, did not change his
quiet manner. If he was disturbed by the unfortunate
beginning, he did not show it. Apparently
ignoring the dancing runner, he slowly faced the
next batter and then suddenly and with terrific speed
sent the ball to Gus Kiggins at first.</p>

<p>The baseman, perhaps caught unaware, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the ball when the runner was at least two feet off
the base. A shout like the sharp report of a pistol
at the misplay arose from the academy contingent,
and the nervousness of the school nine and its
friends increased.</p>

<p>Ned advanced from his place behind the bat and
holding his mask in his hand held a brief whispered
conversation with Dan. The action of the catcher
was greeted by another derisive shout which did not
tend to soothe the feelings of the excited boys. Indeed,
for a moment it almost seemed as if the entire
body of spectators was in an uproar.</p>

<p>Dan settled back into his box and apparently
ignoring the shouts and excitement sent in a swift
straight ball at which the batter struck in an attempt
to bunt. The ball rolled slowly to Dan, who
pounced upon it in a flash, whirled about, and threw
swiftly to the second-baseman. The ball was caught
and then thrown to first, where Gus Kiggins caught
it just before the runner touched the bag.</p>

<p>“Double play!” “That’s the way to do it!”
“We’ve got them started now!” “Two out and
the third man as good as gone!” It was now time
for the supporters of the Tait School to give vent
to their feelings, and the many shouts and calls
finally united in a prolonged school cheer.</p>

<p>Dan meanwhile was keenly watching the player
who now advanced to the plate. A sturdy, solid,
muscular fellow he appeared to be, and the call for
a “home run,” which was raised by several among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
the friends of the academy nine, at once revealed to
the young pitcher that he was facing one of the
heaviest hitters of the opposing nine. He hesitated
a moment, waited for Ned to repeat his signal for
a swift low incurve, and then pitched the ball.</p>

<p>“Strike!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p>“Strike two!” he called again when a swiftly
pitched ball seemed suddenly to swerve from its
course as it came near the plate and almost threaten
the face of the batter.</p>

<p>Drawing back his arm and “winding up” his
body as if he was striving to exert every ounce of
power he possessed, Dan delivered the third ball.
Instead of being a swift ball, however, it was slow,
and its curve, as it crossed the plate, apparently
was outward. The excited batter, however, in his
zeal, struck viciously at what he confidently believed
was to be an unusually swift ball and swung his bat
before the little sphere had even reached the plate.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Disregarding the cheers of the spectators, the
luckless batter waited for Dan to come in and then
said to him good-naturedly, “You got me that time.”</p>

<p>“I was lucky,” responded Dan pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I wish I believed it was just ‘luck.’ Next time
I’m up, I’ll know a little more about it.”</p>

<p>It was now that the Tait School nine was to show
what it was able to do with the bat. Various reports
had come as to the quality and ability of the battery
of the academy nine, but, like Dan, the young pitcher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
was a new boy, consequently no one was able to
speak authoritatively. He assuredly was the one
player whose actions were most keenly observed
when the academy players took their first turn in
the field. The pitcher was tall, wiry, and handled
himself well in the preliminary practice.</p>

<p>“South-paw,” muttered Ned as he watched Ingersoll,
the pitcher of the academy nine.</p>

<p>“That’ll be my finish then,” said Hodge gloomily.
“I can’t hit a left-hander. It’s like striking at the
moon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give up before you begin,” said Ned
sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not a dead one yet,” retorted Hodge,
as he selected his bat and advanced, as the first
batter, to face Ingersoll.</p>

<p>A hush fell over the entire assembly as the motions
of the lanky pitcher were keenly watched by
all observers. A laugh was heard as Ingersoll
twisted his long arms and body almost as if he were
trying to tie it into a knot. Suddenly from the
squirming arms the ball shot forth and Hodge
struck wildly at it, though he did not come within
six inches of the little sphere.</p>

<p>“Strike!” shouted the umpire promptly.</p>

<p>“That fellow is going to wear himself out before
the sixth inning if he keeps that up,” said Ned to
Dan as they were seated side by side on the players’
bench. “He can’t keep that up.”</p>

<p>Dan, after his usual quiet manner, did not reply,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
though he was keenly observant of his rival in the
box as was his friend.</p>

<p>Another strike, then two balls, quickly followed
Hodge’s first attempt, and then the batter struck
savagely at the ball that followed and sent it slowly
rolling toward third base. The baseman easily
stopped the ball, threw it to first, and Hodge was
out.</p>

<p>“Next victim,” muttered Ned as he stepped forward
to the plate. Ned, however, was more fortunate
than his predecessor, for after one strike and
two balls had been called he lifted the little sphere
for a safe hit over second base.</p>

<p>“Now, Gus, remember your country’s need,” said
Smith, as Gus Kiggins’ turn to bat came and the
young giant stepped forward. “Don’t forget that
you’re to make a sacrifice hit.”</p>

<p>If the batter heard the direction he gave it no
heed, for he sent the first ball pitched far over
the head of the left-fielder. Almost on a straight
line the ball sped on, rolling swiftly when at last it
struck the ground, while both the left-fielder and
the center-fielder of the academy ran in swift pursuit.
Pandemonium almost seemed to break loose
among the boys of the Tait School. They rose from
their seats and swung their caps, dancing up and
down in their excitement as they shouted and
cheered wildly. The excitement became still greater
when Gus turned third base and followed Ned toward
the home-plate. The ball by this time had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
been secured and the left-fielder had thrown it,
exerting all his power, to the short-stop, who had
run back to secure it.</p>

<p>There were now wild calls for Gus to increase
his speed. Ned already had crossed the home-plate,
but Gus was fifteen yards away. On and
still on plunged the heavy hitter and the ball was
in the hands of the academy short-stop. Ignoring
the wild shouts of the dancing boys the player
turned and threw swiftly to his catcher. The throw
was accurately made and the ball was caught in the
outstretched hands of the academy catcher when
Gus was five feet away, but the runner did not
hesitate. Throwing himself with all his weight
against the waiting player the two boys fell together
to the ground. Gus instantly arose, but the
other player did not move. The ball had rolled from
his hand, and a shout arose when it was learned that
the run was to count. Silence, however, quickly
followed the noisy demonstration when it was seen
that the academy catcher did not rise. Several of
his teammates ran to his assistance and as they lifted
the player to a standing position the latter, in part
regaining his breath, turned angrily to the umpire
and said, “He fouled me! He struck me with his
fist in the pit of my stomach!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it,” responded the umpire quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, he did!” repeated the catcher. “It was
dirty ball!”</p>

<p>There were glances of anger turned upon Gus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
but the panting player apparently was unmindful of
them all. He seated himself beside Dan on the
bench and in a brief time the game was resumed.</p>

<p>The following batter struck out and Dan, who
followed him, sent a short fly to second base, and
the side was out.</p>

<p>In the next two innings neither side was able to
score. Dan struck out two of the academy players
in each inning and one was out on a high foul which
Hodge caught. The first hit of the academy nine
came in the third inning, when one of the players
drove a sharply hit ball past first base, close to the
foul line. In trying to stretch the well-placed hit
into a two-base hit the runner was thrown out at
second base.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the nine of the Tait School
had not succeeded in scoring again. In the third
inning two hits were made, one by Smith and one
by Walter’s substitute, Sam Ventnor, but both were
held on bases when a double play was made by the
short-stop and first-baseman, the former catching
a fly well back in the field and recovering himself
in time to catch Ned in an attempt to regain first,
which he had secured by a base on balls, thereby
filling the bases.</p>

<p>“Good work, old man,” said Ned to Dan as
the Tait School players started for their positions
at the beginning of the fourth inning. “Keep it up
and we’ll shut out these fellows. We’ve a good
lead.” Dan smiled, for the words of praise were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
vastly encouraging. He was confident that he had
recovered from the nervousness he felt at the beginning
of the game and, furthermore, he was now
aware that the batters, as they faced him, betrayed
in their manner the respect they had for his prowess.
It was true that two runs did not permit any carelessness—the
margin was too narrow. But he had
found in preceding games that his power of endurance
could be relied upon and that his work in the
closing innings was never weaker than at the beginning.</p>

<p>“There comes Walter,” he said to Ned as he
stopped and saw his roommate approaching. “I
wonder if he is in shape to play? He has his
uniform on, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see next inning,” said Captain Ned
brusquely. “We seem to be getting on fairly well
without him.”</p>

<p>“Give him a chance, Ned,” pleaded Dan. “I
know how he feels.”</p>

<p>“I know how he ought to feel,” growled Ned.
“I’ll see about him when we come in to bat again.”</p>

<p>Dan said no more and walked slowly toward the
pitcher’s box. Already the infield players had taken
their places and the ball was being passed swiftly
from one to another. The noisy demonstrations of
the spectators now had given place to a deeper,
though more quiet, feeling of excitement. Every
play was watched anxiously and in spite of the
prevailing quiet Dan knew as well as the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
players that the shouts and cheers would break
forth again at the first opportunity a hit or play
might provide.</p>

<p>Dan was standing with his face toward third
base watching the work of Hodge, who at that moment
was throwing across the diamond to Gus, the
latter quickly and swiftly returning the ball.</p>

<p>Suddenly Gus threw swiftly to Dan, who was
unaware of the change. “Look out! Look out,
Dan!” shouted Hodge warningly. But the word
was not heard in time by the young pitcher. The
ball which Gus had thrown with unusual swiftness
struck Dan squarely on his right arm between
the elbow and shoulder.</p>

<p>With a cry of pain Dan clasped the spot with his
left hand and bending low almost fell to the ground.</p>

<small>THE END OF THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In a brief time the confusion spread over the
entire assembly. Ned ran to his friend and the
players of both teams swarmed upon the field.
Even the spectators shared in the prevailing excitement
and were standing looking interestedly at the
group which by this time had surrounded Dan.</p>

<p>Among the first to reach his side was Gus Kiggins.
“Honestly, Dan, I didn’t mean to do it,” he
said excitedly. “I thought you saw me! I’m
sorry! I’m——”</p>

<p>“Get away, will you!” broke in Ned savagely.
Thrusting aside the player who had been the cause
of the trouble, Ned examined the arm which already
was showing the effect of the blow. “Does it hurt
much, Dan?” he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>The young pitcher smiled faintly and did not
reply, though the paleness of his face fully answered
his friend’s query.</p>

<p>“Let me rub it,” suggested Hodge.</p>

<p>“Get some water—hot water,” added Smith,
every boy being anxious to do something for the
relief of Dan.</p>

<p>“Can you go on with the game?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll try,” answered Dan by an effort. “Let me
see if I can throw.” Taking the ball from the
umpire’s hand Dan swung his arm, but quickly
dropped the ball. “No use,” he said slowly. “My
arm won’t work.”</p>

<p>The members of the nine glanced helplessly at
one another and then glared at Gus, the source of
all the trouble.</p>

<p>“I told you I didn’t mean to do it,” Gus growled.
“I thought he saw me. We were all passing the
ball——”</p>

<p>“Gus, do you think a dose of ipecac would help
him?” said Ned in a low voice to his first-baseman.
There was almost a glitter in the eyes of the young
captain, he was so angry. Nor did his feeling find
relief when Gus Kiggins growled, “What’s the
matter with you?” But he did not reply to the
question.</p>

<p>The delay continued five minutes and then the
game was resumed with Gus taking Dan’s place
in the pitcher’s box, Walter going to short-stop,
and Sam Ventnor playing first base. Dan, who
was taken to the dressing-room to receive the attention
of a physician, who was found among the
spectators, in a brief time returned to the field and
seated himself on the players’ bench, there to watch
the game in which he was to have no further part.
The glances of sympathy which were given him as
he had walked in front of the grand stand on his way
to the bench had not soothed his feelings and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
three substitute players who were sitting beside
him he barely spoke in reply to their anxious questions.</p>

<p>“Does your arm hurt?” asked Snell, the first
substitute.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine question,” answered Dan somewhat
tartly. “What did you think? Would it
make my pitching arm feel good to hit it with a
ball?”</p>

<p>“Of course. I understand,” said Snell lamely.
“All I meant was to find out if you thought you’d
get in the game again.”</p>

<p>“Not this game. What’s the score? How is it
going?”</p>

<p>“The Military Academy fellows made a run last
inning.”</p>

<p>“This is the fifth inning.”</p>

<p>“No. It’s the sixth.”</p>

<p>“How is Gus doing?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well. They’re hitting him some, though.
There! Look at that, will you!” Snell added
abruptly. “A three-bagger!”</p>

<p>At the moment a shout that came almost with
the sharpness of the report of a gun arose from
the seats occupied by the friends of the academy
nine. Two men were on bases when their heaviest
hitter came to bat and when his long hit was made
the two players before him raced home with their
tallies.</p>

<p>“Dan, you’ll have to go back to the pitcher’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
box!” exclaimed Snell as the cheering of the opposing
section was renewed when the runner on
third came in with the third run of the inning, after
the batter had sent a long fly to left field which
Smith captured.</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“You must. That makes the score four to two.
We can’t stand that. They’re hammering Gus!
They’ll drive him out of the box.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t look as if they would,” suggested
Dan as the next player struck out.</p>

<p>“Three in one inning,” muttered Snell hopelessly.</p>

<p>“The game is young.”</p>

<p>“If it is that bad when it’s young, what will it
be when it is older?”</p>

<p>“Better for us, I hope.”</p>

<p>The school players came toward the bench, every
one looking anxiously at Dan and eagerly inquiring
concerning his hurt. The glances of anger at Gus
when it became manifest that Dan was out of the
present game were frequent and unmistakable. The
substitute pitcher, however, apparently was giving
slight heed to the looks of his comrades. His face
was streaming with perspiration, while his jaws
were working as if every second of time had its
special value.</p>

<p>Between Gus and the other members of the nine
sat Walter, his face still betraying the sickness
he had suffered and his bearing showing that he was
far from feeling at ease at the moment. He glanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
repeatedly at Dan, who was the center of a group,
but he did not speak.</p>

<p>“Brace up, fellows!” said Ned anxiously as he
faced his fellow players. “Now is the time to
show the stuff you’re made of! We mustn’t let a
little thing like a lead of three runs scare us. Do
your best!”</p>

<p>The encouraging words of the young captain did
not avail, however. The lanky Ingersoll seemed to
have acquired an additional power in his wirelike
arms and his body went through contortions that
made his earlier efforts appear like child’s play.
Walter struck out. Sam Ventnor sent a little fly
to the first-baseman. Gus Kiggins indeed made a
hit, but it counted for nothing, as the batter that
followed him was easily thrown out at first.</p>

<p>The Military Academy nine, however, did no
better when their turn to bat came and neither of
the following innings was productive of a run for
either side.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to do something now,” said
Ned desperately as he turned to his companions a
moment before he advanced to the plate to begin
the Tait School’s half of the eighth inning.</p>

<p>“Set us a good example, Neddie boy,” said
Hodge encouragingly.</p>

<p>Ned’s face was grim with determination as he
faced the opposing pitcher. He was deliberate and
cool and waited until two strikes and two balls had
been called before he attempted to strike. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
hitting savagely, he sent the ball on a low line far
into center field.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Tait School to express
its feelings in a long shout. The wild cries
redoubled as Ned gained third and then with a burst
of speed turned and raced for the home-plate. The
ball was fielded well and now was in the hands
of the second-baseman, but the nerve-racking strain
was too great. In his attempt to throw quickly the
ball went far over the head of the catcher and Ned
was safe.</p>

<p>“Five to three! Five to three! Five to three!”
came as a monotonous chant from the seats of the
academy contingent. The cry could be heard above
the wild shouts of the Tait School supporters, who
still were shouting wildly over the hit and the run
of their captain.</p>

<p>“Remember the example Ned set,” said Smith as
Hodge stepped forward with his bat. “Keep it up,
you midget!”</p>

<p>The spectators were silent once more as all excitedly
watched the batter. The powerful Hodge
made a lunge at the first ball pitched and sent it
just over the head of the third-baseman.</p>

<p>“A hit!” “You’ve got them on the run now!”
“Keep it up! Keep it up!” were the rejoicing calls
that greeted Gus as his turn to bat came.</p>

<p>This time the young giant for some reason was
more responsive to his orders and instead of exerting
all his strength he did his utmost to make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
sacrifice hit, but the ball rolled to second base, was
hastily seized by the baseman, who touched his base,
and then hurled the ball to first just in time to
catch Gus.</p>

<p>“Double play!” “Two down!” “This fellow
is easy!” roared some of the enthusiasts in the
academy section. “Strike him out!” “Don’t let
him hit it!” “Careful!” “Careful!” were among
the encouraging words shouted to the tall pitcher.</p>

<p>Apparently Ingersoll responded to the appeal, for
he struck out the next player and the side was out.</p>

<p>As all were aware that the incoming inning was
the last for each nine, the excitement became more
intense. When the Military Academy nine made a
run the delight of their supporters became still
greater, and though the confidence of the academy
contingent was strong, nevertheless they were all
anxious when the Tait School hitters came to bat
for what was likely to be the last time in the game.</p>

<p>Every player was cautious now and if in his
anxiety he did not become overanxious the score
was not likely to be changed. Ned was slapping his
players on the back and urging everyone to do his
utmost. The last opportunity to score ought not to
be lost.</p>

<p>“Up in the air!” shouted Smith, who was on the
coaching line near first base when Walter, the first
player to face Ingersoll, was given his base on balls.
In his delight Smith leaned over and pulled grass
with each hand as he continued his wild shouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p>The academy, however, responded vociferously
when the next man struck out, and their shouts were
prolonged and wilder when the following batter sent
up a fly which was caught by the nimble player in
right field.</p>

<p>“All over but the shouting!” called one hilarious
supporter of the academy.</p>

<p>“Is it?” called Smith derisively, as the runner
he was coaching started swiftly for second base,
and out of the cloud of dust that was stirred up as
he threw himself forward the decision “safe” was
heard.</p>

<p>To the delight of the nine Walter boldly started,
at the first ball pitched, for third base, and when
it was seen that his steal had been successful the
shouts and calls redoubled. A hit now would mean
another run, and if the batter gained his base another
run which would tie the score was not impossible.
The wild calls died away a brief moment and
then burst forth in redoubled power when the batter
drove a sharp grounder between first and second
and Walter made “home” with another run. The
brief rejoicing hushed when Ned lifted a high fly
into left field. The fielder first ran back, then
turned and raced forward, and then stopped, awaiting
the coming of the ball. A deathlike silence fell
over the field and benches alike. Every face was
turned toward the young fielder. Gus ran forward
from the bench and crouched low as he watched the
ball. Apparently it seemed to be falling slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
The fielder stood motionless. Suddenly he put up
his hands and caught it. The nine of the Military
Academy had won the first game of the interschool
series by a score of five to four.</p>

<p>A noisy cheer greeted the catch and then in comparative
silence the assembled spectators began to
move from the seats toward the waiting automobiles
and carriages. The crowd halted a moment
to listen to the cheers which the victorious nine
gave as they assembled and then to the cheers of
the Tait School nine.</p>

<p>The latter stood close together, every player resting
his hands on the shoulders of a teammate. The
cheer rose with a great volume of sound, but in it
there was to be detected something of the disappointment
everyone felt. The game had been well
played, but defeat was still defeat.</p>

<p>“Too bad, Ned,” said Dan as his friend walked
beside him. “We’ll try to do better next time. It’s
early in the season yet, you know.”</p>

<p>“How is your arm?” asked Ned abruptly.</p>

<p>“Sore.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way we all feel,” snapped Ned. “If
you had kept on we’d have won the game.”</p>

<p>“That’s something no man knows.”</p>

<p>“It’s what everybody here knows!”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Perhaps being beaten in the first
game will make us all the better for the series.
Isn’t the Military Academy nine about the strongest
in the league?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t so strong as ours when you pitch. What
do you think, Dan; did Gus do that on purpose?”</p>

<p>“He says he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“No one believes him.”</p>

<p>Dan did not reply and at that moment Carlton
Hall came running to the side of the young pitcher.
“O Dan!” he exclaimed. “Wasn’t it too bad?
Didn’t you see Gus Kiggins when he threw that
ball?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have hit me if I had.”</p>

<p>“Some of the fellows say he did it on purpose
just the same as he tried to get you out of the game
by making you sick beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?” demanded Dan sharply. “You
mustn’t listen——”</p>

<p>Dan stopped abruptly as Walter and Gus at that
moment joined the three boys. Had Carlton’s words
been heard? Dan was unable to determine from
the expression on the face of the player who had
taken his place in the pitcher’s box. Even the
thought, however, was forgotten in the words which
Gus spoke.</p>

<small>THE ANGER OF THE NINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Do you fellows believe I meant to hit Dan?”
asked Gus, as he joined the boys and walked
beside them on the way to the dressing-room.</p>

<p>“What makes you think we do?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Do you think I intended to hit you, Dan?”
asked Gus, turning to the young pitcher.</p>

<p>“You did hit me,” said Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“I know I did; but you can believe me or not,
I didn’t mean to. I’ll own up that I threw the ball
hard, but I thought, of course, you saw me.”</p>

<p>As Dan did not reply, Ned said to Gus, “Have
you any idea what made Walter sick?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask me that?” retorted Gus.</p>

<p>“He seemed to be suffering from a peculiar
trouble. He was deathly sick and then, in a little
while, he was all right again. He put up a good
game after he went in at short.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I had anything to do with his
being sick?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say you did. I just asked you if you
knew what made him sick?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m to blame for that error Hodge
made in the fifth inning too,” said Gus gruffly. “If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
anything goes wrong, then I’m the one to blame.
I don’t know why all the fellows are down on me.
I pitched my prettiest after Dan was—after he
gave out. I’m to blame for losing the game too, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t ‘blamed’ you for anything, Gus,”
said Ned warmly. “You’re getting away off the
track. All I asked you was whether or not you
could give a guess about what made Walter
sick. You have switched off on to something else
and haven’t said a word about that.”</p>

<p>“What do you want me to say?”</p>

<p>“Whatever you choose.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why you suspect me of making
Walter sick. What earthly reason would I have
for wanting to get him out of the game?”</p>

<p>“Was there anyone you wanted to put out of the
game?” Ned’s face was flushed and, as he looked
straight at Gus while speaking, the latter was unable
entirely to conceal his uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Here comes Walter. Ask him if he thinks I
tried to poison him,” said Gus.</p>

<p>“Feeling better?” inquired Ned, as the short-stop
walked beside him.</p>

<p>“I’m all right now,” said Walter quietly.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Ned, “we were just asking Gus if
he had any idea what it was that made you sick just
before the game.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you?” inquired Walter, as he looked
half angrily at Gus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“He didn’t say you had too much ipecac in the
apollinaris.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say what?” interrupted Walter
aghast, staring first at Ned and then at Gus.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say that you got the wrong glass,
but——”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d say right out just what you’ve got
to say,” broke in Walter peevishly. “I’m not good
at riddles.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Gus Kiggins with a growl, “the fellows
are all down on me. First they say I tried to
disable Dan’s pitching arm; then they say Hodge’s
error in the fifth was my fault; then the reason why
none of them could hit Ingersoll was because I’d
fixed it up with him; and now they say I doctored
your lemonade and made you sick. Give a dog a
bad name——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Gus Kiggins!” broke in Ned with
eyes flashing. “You know you’re just talking to
hear yourself talk. We happen to know about that
ipecac.”</p>

<p>“What about it?”</p>

<p>“You had it all fixed for Dan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I tried to make Dan sick too, did I?” said
Gus in real or pretended scorn. “Next you’ll
have me down for trying to poison the whole
school. Why should I want to play such a trick as
that upon Dan? If you should accuse me of wanting
to get Ingersoll out of the game——”</p>

<p>“No use, Gus,” broke in Ned quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it. You condemn me without
hearing a word.”</p>

<p>“We have heard. We know all about the scheme
you and Walter——”</p>

<p>“What ‘scheme’ are you talking about?”
shouted Gus.</p>

<p>“Just what I’m telling you. Someone overheard
you two talking it over and we decided that we’d
just be ready for you.”</p>

<p>“Who heard us?” demanded Gus.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Somebody heard you. That’s
enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we do it then?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the fault of either of you that it didn’t
go through.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“That lemonade had been fixed.”</p>

<p>“Then why wasn’t every fellow sick?”</p>

<p>“Because only one fellow was to be——”</p>

<p>“Who was that?”</p>

<p>“Dan.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he get sick then?”</p>

<p>“Because we let Walter have the glass intended
for Dan.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know who put any such stuff as that
into your heads!” said Gus savagely. “I’d show
him——”</p>

<p>The angry young giant stopped abruptly as his
eyes fell upon little Carlton Hall who, with great
pride, was walking beside Dan. As the glance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
Gus fell upon him, Carlton slunk back in terror and
clutched Dan by the arm.</p>

<p>“It might help to clear up matters a little if you
would kindly explain how it was that Walter happened
to be sick after he took the glass which was
intended for Dan,” said Ned bitterly.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any use in my saying a word,” declared
Gus as he turned away. “You wouldn’t
believe me under oath.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” said Smith, who had not known
of the plot, and his surprise and anger were consequently
greater.</p>

<p>Gus turned abruptly and for a moment the boys
believed he was about to attack Smith, but if that
was in his mind he evidently thought better of his
purpose as he became aware of the unfriendly
glances of all in the group.</p>

<p>“We haven’t come to the end yet,” called Ned
as Gus departed.</p>

<p>The indignation of the boys increased as they
entered the dressing-room and it might have fared
ill with Gus if he had remained with his companions
instead of proceeding directly to his own
room.</p>

<p>“It’s the worst I ever heard!” said Smith. “I
knew that Gus was jealous of Dan, but I didn’t believe
even he would stoop to such a low-lived trick
as to try to keep him out of the game by feeding
him on ipecac! How did you find out about it anyway,
Ned?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“Somebody overheard the talk,” answered Ned
glancing at Walter, who had remained with the
boys.</p>

<p>Not a word had Walter spoken since he entered
the room. His face was colorless and his suffering
was manifest to all, but the troubled boy, as he
occasionally looked about him, saw only the expression
of anger and disgust on every face. Dan too
had been silent and his face betrayed an anxiety
hardly less than that of Walter’s. In a brief time
the boys were dressed and departed.</p>

<p>As they came out of the building Carlton Hall,
who had been waiting for Dan, rushed to the side
of his friend and seizing his hand said in a low
voice, “I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“What are you afraid of?” asked Dan with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Gus Kiggins. When he started for his room he
saw me and I thought he was going to strike me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He stopped all at once and then
went right on.”</p>

<p>“He won’t touch you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will! I know he will! He’ll kill me,
because he thinks I was the one that heard him talking
to Walter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared. If he sees you acting in this
way, then he may think you had something to do
with it. Run along now and don’t act as if you
were frightened. He won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>Carlton obediently departed, and Dan’s heart, as
he watched the little fellow, almost smote him. The
boy had developed wonderfully during the school
year, but he was a slight lad and not able as yet
to fight his own battles. Then too, Dan had spoken
more confidently than his real feelings had warranted.
He was by no means certain that Gus
would not wreak his vengeance upon the boy, who
was unable to defend himself. And yet Gus had no
knowledge that Carlton had been the informer, and
the thought relieved his fear.</p>

<p>“How is your arm, Dan?” inquired Hodge as
he joined his friend.</p>

<p>“Sore,” replied Dan lightly.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder it wasn’t broken. What a low-down,
sneaking piece of business that was. Don’t
you think Gus did it on purpose?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You’re too easy. All the fellows know that he
had made up his mind that you shouldn’t keep him
out of the box. And he got the place too—worse
luck! He made us lose the game.”</p>

<p>“No one knows that.”</p>

<p>“Everybody knows it!” retorted Hodge. “The
low-lived sneak! I don’t envy him when the school
finds out about it. This place will be too hot for
Gus Kiggins! It isn’t the first time, either, that
he has been up to his dirty tricks.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use, Hodge? If it is all true, why,
I’m the one that had the worst of it——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>“When we lost the game?” broke in Hodge.
“Not much! If we had won, Gus might have put
on a bold face and carried his bluff through, but
now he’s a home boy as sure as you’re born. Believe
me, he won’t stay around here long.”</p>

<p>Dan would have been less than human if the words
of praise and sympathy had not found a warm response
in his heart. He had endured the taunts and
flings of Gus Kiggins, aware in part that the boy
was jealous of him. Seldom had anyone crossed
the path of the school bully; those who were not
afraid of him preferring to leave him to himself,
while those who were afraid seldom disputed his
claims. Even Dan, inexperienced as he was, had
found that there was a measure of satisfaction in
the thought that Gus had vented his anger upon
him because he was jealous of the skill that had
been shown. Dan knew that if he had displayed no
ability in the pitcher’s box, Gus would have ignored
him. Among the few words Mr. Borden had
spoken to Dan was one warning which had not been
forgotten. “Don’t forget,” Mr. Borden had said,
“that no man ever does well without somebody being
envious of him. The true man understands that
and does not let the petty jealousy of others trouble
him.”</p>

<p>Dan recalled the words now and the recollection
helped him. He was in deep trouble as he thought
of Walter. The boy, somehow, had come under the
influence of Gus, until his life was poisoned. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
would Walter say now? How would he bear the
feeling of the school, for there could be no doubt
he would share with Gus the indignation all felt.
These questions were in Dan’s mind when he went
up and found Walter alone in their room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br>
<small>DAN’S STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The two boys stood a moment looking at each
other in silence. Walter was the first to
speak and his voice trembled as he said:</p>

<p>“Dan, do you believe it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” replied Dan quietly.</p>

<p>“But do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; at least, I believe a part.”</p>

<p>“Which part?”</p>

<p>“That about the ipecac.”</p>

<p>“What don’t you believe?”</p>

<p>“That Gus Kiggins intended to hit me with the
ball.”</p>

<p>“Surely you don’t think I had anything to do
with that!”</p>

<p>“Of course I don’t, Walter.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I had anything to do with the
ipecac?”</p>

<p>“You know better than I do about that.”</p>

<p>“Do you?” said Walter persistently.</p>

<p>“I hate to believe it, Walter.”</p>

<p>“That means you think I did.”</p>

<p>As Dan was silent the troubled boy looked at
his roommate in a manner that increased the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
uneasiness of both. As Dan glanced out the window
a moment he saw Carlton Hall running across
the campus toward the dormitory, but he gave the
little fellow no thought. He was troubled now
by more serious matters than the trials of a boy
in the fourth form.</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Walter at last, “I’m the most miserable
fellow in the Tait School.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“It seems as if everything and everybody was
against me. I don’t know why it is that Gus got me
into such things.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Walter irritably.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Dan quietly, “didn’t you know
what kind of a fellow Gus was when you began to
run with him?”</p>

<p>“I thought all the fellows were down on him.
He isn’t as bad as some of them say he is.”</p>

<p>“That’s very likely so.”</p>

<p>“But this thing is the worst——”</p>

<p>“What thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what I mean. This ipecac business.”</p>

<p>“Why did Gus want to make me sick?”</p>

<p>“You know that too. He expected to be the
pitcher of the nine. Everybody else expected him to
be too. At first Gus was down on me for bringing
you here, but he got over that. He had two
plans going—one was to make you just sick enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
so that you couldn’t play in the game with the
academy or, if you did play, that you’d fall down
and the fellows would have to call on him; and the
other was to try to have the officers of the league
bring a charge against you—that you were a professional—had
been paid for playing.”</p>

<p>“How did Gus think he could do that?”</p>

<p>“He had a letter from that harness-maker at
Rodman——”</p>

<p>“Who? Si?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t say I was a professional, did
he?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly; but his letter was a funny one.
Even you would laugh if you should read it.”</p>

<p>“What did Si write?”</p>

<p>“A lot of stuff. He praised you to the skies
and went on to say that every man, woman, and
child in Rodman knew that you had had an offer
to play on a professional team ‘for big money,’ as
he put it. Of course his letter was worded in such
a way that one might think you had been paid——”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Dan shortly. “Did Gus
write the letter?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, though I’m afraid I helped,” said Walter
slowly.</p>

<p>“How did Gus know about the harness-maker?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I told him that too,” said Walter
wretchedly. “But the letter hasn’t been used,” he
added eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“How do you know it hasn’t?”</p>

<p>“Why—you see—I thought—I thought I had
the letter in my pocket!” exclaimed Walter aghast
as, after feeling in every pocket, he failed to find the
missive.</p>

<p>“Probably Gus has it or has had it and sent it
on,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“That isn’t square, Dan!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it isn’t. So Gus was holding back the
letter until he had tried a dose of ipecac on me,
was he?”</p>

<p>“That was the plan,” faltered Walter.</p>

<p>“Well, Gus pitched to-day anyway. He ought
to be satisfied.”</p>

<p>“But he lost the game.”</p>

<p>“Say the game was lost.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the same. Dan, there isn’t any use in
trying to mince matters. I can’t say anything. You
know I was mixed up in the matter and it served
me right too when I got the glass with the ipecac
in it. I’m all broken up, Dan. Do you think you
ever can call it square?”</p>

<p>“Walter,” began Dan soberly, “I want you to
know——”</p>

<p>What it was that Dan desired to say was left
unspoken for, at that moment, a loud piercing
scream came from the hall below.</p>

<p>Without a word Dan darted from the room
and, leaping down the stairway, came face to face
with Gus Kiggins. The burly giant was holding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Carlton Hall by his left wrist and was twisting the
arm of the little fellow in a way that had brought
forth the screams of pain which had startled the
two boys.</p>

<p>“You little sneak,” Gus was saying to Carlton,
“you will go and tell the fellows that I tried to
make Dan sick, will you? I’ll teach you! You’ll
get what you deserve if I have to——”</p>

<p>Gus stopped abruptly as Dan stood before him.
“Let go of the little fellow,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“I’ll let him go just as soon as I have——”</p>

<p>“Let him go!” interrupted Dan in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll let him go!” shouted Gus as he abruptly
released his grasp on Carlton and turned savagely
upon Dan. “You’re another! You’re a fraud!
You run around with your pious whine and try to
do the ‘good little boy’ act! I’ve been aching to
get a chance at you, you bean-fed, white-livered,
country hypocrite!” Raising his fist he struck
blindly at the boy before him.</p>

<p>Dan, who was cool, stepped nimbly to one side
to avoid the blow and Gus lurched heavily forward.
Before he could recover himself, little Carlton Hall
suddenly flung himself forward and grasped the
knees of the infuriated young giant. Gus staggered
as he strove to free himself and as he released one
foot he kicked viciously at the prostrate boy. Carlton’s
grasp relaxed and, with a groan, he fell upon
the floor.</p>

<p>The sight of the white upturned face was more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
than Dan could endure. Without a word he flung
himself upon Gus, exerting himself to the utmost to
thrust him out of the open door. Instantly Walter
joined in the fray but, even with his aid, Dan
was scarcely able to move the struggling giant.</p>

<p>How the contest would have ended he did not
know, but at that moment Hodge and Ned entered
the hall. For an instant they gazed in astonishment
at the sight of the combatants and then the meaning
of it all became clear. Without a word they seized
Gus, and while one held his right arm and the other
his left, the furious boy was speedily helpless, if not
subdued, in their hands.</p>

<p>“Now then, Gus Kiggins, what have you got to
say for yourself?” demanded Ned, as he looked
into the face before him.</p>

<p>“You’re all down on me. Nobody in the school
gives me a fair show,” whimpered Gus. Then,
crazed by his rage, he suddenly exerted himself with
all his strength and breaking away with an unexpected
action ran swiftly to the door and fled from
the building.</p>

<p>“He’s gone,” said Ned breathlessly.</p>

<p>Dan did not speak, but turning hastily to Carlton,
who was still lying where he had fallen, he
lifted the little fellow and said, “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“My side. He kicked me,” whispered the boy.</p>

<p>Briefly Dan related to his friends what had occurred
and with many exclamations of anger Ned
assisted Dan to carry Carlton up to his room, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
an examination was made after Carlton had been
placed on a bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he is badly hurt,” said Hodge.
“He had his wind knocked out of him by that hard
kick; that seems to be about all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go for a doctor,” suggested Walter hastily.
But Carlton himself protested so strongly that the
plan was abandoned—at least for the present—and
then the four boys seated themselves to talk
over what had occurred and what was to be done.</p>

<p>“That fellow will leave to-night if he knows
what is good for him!” said Ned angrily. “He’s
the worst I ever saw. Did he hurt your pitching
arm any more?” he added, turning to Dan as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I can’t just tell,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can pitch next week?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be in a hole if you can’t. Come on. We’ll
go over and get the doctor started on it right away.”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, fellows,” said Walter. “I’ve
got something I want to say to you.”</p>

<p>“Say it and be quick about it,” replied Ned
brusquely.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you all that I’ve been a chump.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Walter, you certainly have,” said
Hodge brutally.</p>

<p>“I know it a good deal better than you do,” continued
Walter, his face betraying his deep feeling.
“There isn’t any use in my saying I’m sorry. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
don’t see how I could have done it. If you fellows
want to put somebody in my place at short, I’ll agree
to it. I’ll agree to anything that you may suggest.
From now on, I want to be fair.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more, Walter,” interrupted Dan.</p>

<p>“Let him say it,” protested Ned. “It’ll do him
good. When a fellow has let himself be made a fool
of by such a chap as Gus Kiggins, he can’t do
any more——”</p>

<p>“That’s right. He’s said enough. We all understand.”</p>

<p>“Do you call it off, Dan?” demanded Hodge.</p>

<p>“I most certainly do.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are agreed, I don’t think there’s
much for the rest of us to say.”</p>

<p>“Come on, Ned,” suggested Dan uneasily. “I
thought you wanted me to go over to the doctor’s
with you and get something for my arm.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Ned, rising promptly. “We’ll settle
this later,” he added, as he faced the boys.</p>

<p>“It’s all settled now,” said Dan quietly. “Everybody
makes mistakes. I didn’t know what a butter-plate
was for when I came.”</p>

<p>Walter’s face flushed at Dan’s words and his
roommate hastily added, “Will you look after Carlton
till I come back?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anybody to look after me,” spoke
up Carlton sturdily, “I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, kid!” laughed Hodge. “We’ll
make a man of you yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll look after him, Dan, or do anything you
want,” said Walter humbly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too good, Walter,” laughed Ned, who
was as rejoiced as his companions over what had
been said. “There’s such a thing as being too good
to be true, you know. Come on, Dan!”</p>

<p>When the two boys returned from the doctor’s
office, both were astounded by the report of the doings
of Gus Kiggins—a report which Walter and
Carlton were waiting to give them.</p>

<small>THE FINAL GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“What do you think!” exclaimed Walter excitedly,
“Gus Kiggins has left!”</p>

<p>“Left?” demanded Hodge. “What do you
mean? Has he left school?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s exactly what he has done. Packed
up bag and baggage and left town on the evening
train.”</p>

<p>“Without a word?” asked Hodge, unable to conceal
his surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he’s gone for good.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“He told me so himself. I went over to his
room to tell him it was all off between him and
me——”</p>

<p>“You went to his room?” broke in Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s just what I did. After I found
out that Carlton was not going to die——”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” interrupted Carlton sharply. The
little fellow’s face was still white and betrayed the
pain he still was suffering, but the boy’s determination
was so manifest that the older boys in the
room were quick to see and approve his newly found
courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk, kid,” said Hodge encouragingly.
“‘Never say die.’ You’re learning
to be something more than mamma’s nice little boy.
The Tait School will make a man of you yet.”
Then turning to Walter he added, “Go on with
your merry tale.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know at first,” resumed Walter, “but
that he was going to do me as he did Carlton, he
was so nearly beside himself. When I told him I
was done with him he was worse than ever. He
said that was just like me, I’d be like the fellows
I was with last and that Hodge and Ned and Dan
had set me up to it.” Walter steadily held to his
story, though Dan at least was aware of the effort
it cost the impulsive boy to relate what Gus had
said. “He said,” continued Walter, “that he wasn’t
going to see even the doctor, he was just going to
leave, and the sooner he could get out the better it
would be for everybody.”</p>

<p>“I guess he was wise,” laughed Hodge. “I’m
glad he’s gone.”</p>

<p>“I did my best to calm him down,” said Walter,
“for I knew he’d be sorry by to-morrow. He
wouldn’t listen to a word I said, though, and now
that he has really left I don’t feel sorry. I’m sorry
I let him make such a fool of me as he did. I can
see it all now.”</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Ned more seriously, “did it ever
occur to you that Gus Kiggins might have a successor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” replied Walter,
his face flushing as he spoke. “Who will be his
successor? What kind will he be?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to preach to you, Walter, for I
don’t know how, but I’m telling you that a fellow
is always ‘up against’ some such proposition. If
it isn’t Gus Kiggins, then it’s some other chap that
can do his work.”</p>

<p>“And you think when Gus’s ‘successor,’ as you
call him, comes along that I’ll be following him just
the way I did Gus?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>

<p>“That is what you meant.”</p>

<p>“Walter is all right,” spoke up Dan quietly.
“He’s had his medicine——”</p>

<p>“You mean the ipecac?” interrupted Ned.</p>

<p>Even Walter joined in the laugh that followed,
though his expression was not one of pure enjoyment.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean,” continued Dan. “I
had to learn what a butter-plate was for. It
troubled me a good deal at first, but I got a lot of
comfort out of the fact that every fellow had to
learn something. If it wasn’t butter-plates, then it
was something else. Walter, here, had to learn to
stand up——”</p>

<p>“I was in the history class the other day,” piped
in Carlton.</p>

<p>“Good for you, kid,” retorted Hodge. “Glad
to hear you were where you ought to be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“I was there in a way,” said Carlton. “Mr.
Sutherland called on me to recite——”</p>

<p>“I sincerely trust you did yourself proud,” suggested
Hodge demurely.</p>

<p>“Oh, let the little fellow tell his story,” protested
Dan.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, kid,” said Hodge good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sutherland asked me what were the five
great races of mankind,” related Carlton.</p>

<p>“That’s dead easy,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is easy for you fellows. I thought
it was easy myself, but when I told him that the five
great races were the hundred-yard dash, the two-hundred-and-twenty-yards,
the four-forty, the half-mile
run, and the mile he didn’t seem to be a bit
pleased with my answer. I’ll leave it to you fellows
if that isn’t the truth. But Mr. Sutherland sent me
out of the room.”</p>

<p>A shout of delight came from the boys and whatever
of feeling may have existed apparently disappeared.</p>

<p>“You surely are coming on,” laughed Ned as he
ruffled the little fellow’s hair. “You’ll be on the
nine yet.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think I ever will?” said Carlton
eagerly.</p>

<p>“If you keep on this way you’ll take Dan’s place
in the box.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of the ‘box’—who’s going to take
Dan’s place now?” asked Walter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“No one—we hope,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Can he work next week?” asked Walter eagerly.</p>

<p>“The doctor man says he thinks so, at least he’ll
be good for a part of the game. The arm has a
bad bump, but it’ll be all right pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Great!” exclaimed Carlton excitedly, his face
beaming with the worship of his hero. “Then we’ll
win the championship yet. There’s another game
with the Military Academy——”</p>

<p>“On their grounds,” suggested Dan dryly.</p>

<p>“That won’t make any difference—if your arm
is all right.”</p>

<p>“And our nine can hit enough to make a few
runs,” suggested Ned. “It’s all well enough to
have a good pitcher, but all he can do is to keep
the other fellows from scoring. That doesn’t win
a game.”</p>

<p>“It keeps the other nine from winning, doesn’t
it?” demanded Walter, now quick to come to the
support of his roommate.</p>

<p>“I guess it does,” laughed Ned, “but I’m telling
you that we’ll have to do better work with the bat
than we did to-day if we are going to win out in
the new league.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it,” said Walter confidently.</p>

<p>The confidence in a measure was shattered when
the following Saturday it was found that Dan’s arm
had not entirely recovered. The departure of Gus
Kiggins had been variously interpreted by the school,
a few siding with him after he was gone, thereby<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
displaying the fact that a school world is not unlike
the great world outside. However, while the
great majority of the boys were not sorrowing over
the departure of the bully, nevertheless the prevailing
feeling of anxiety concerning the pitcher for the
school nine, in case Dan was unable to play, was
great. Indeed, when the game came and those in
attendance saw that Dan was not in the box, there
were many to prophesy that the high school would
win.</p>

<p>At the end of the fourth inning the score was
six to five against the Tait School. A great cheer
arose when, in the following inning, Dan became
the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Saving him,” explained Carlton excitedly to
Ben White, who was seated next him in the cheering
section.</p>

<p>Whether Dan had been “saved” for this need
or not, when he replaced Matteson, who had been
called in from center field to do his best in the
pitcher’s box, the scoring of the high-school nine
abruptly stopped and as the Tait School nine scored
four more runs the game was won by a score of
nine to six.</p>

<p>The return games in due course were also won
by safe margins, but as the nine of the Military
Academy had also won from one of the two schools
and also had defeated the Tait School, the last-named
nine was still tied for first place in the
league. Indeed, as the series progressed it became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
manifest that in reality the nines from the Military
Academy and the Tait School far outclassed their
rivals. The test between these two nines was to
occur in the final game. If the academy should win,
it could claim the championship by a game.</p>

<p>The excitement in the Tait School never had
run higher than on that June day when the entire
student body in a special train started for the
academy grounds. Cheer leaders, leaders of the
school songs, and various other functionaries had
been selected, new cheers and new songs had been
carefully rehearsed, and if loyal support would aid
Dan and his fellow players, then the Tait School
nine ought to win.</p>

<p>But the students of the Military Academy were
equally well prepared to support their players, and
song had been prepared to meet song and cheer
to respond to cheer.</p>

<p>On the grounds were the students of the two
other schools in the league, both hopeless now of
victory, but warm in their support of the rival nines
that were to play that day and about equally divided
in their allegiance.</p>

<p>The scene was unlike any which Dan had ever
beheld when he, with his companions, at last began
their preliminary practice on the diamond. The
stands were bright with color, and automobiles and
carriages were several deep around the field. The
sky was cloudless and the weather was intensely
warm—a day when the players might do their best,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
but also one in which the endurance of both the
nines would be severely tested.</p>

<p>“Great day for the game,” said Ned as he patted
Dan on the shoulder when the latter took a ball in
his hand and started toward one side of the field
to “warm up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, one of the finest I ever saw. Look at the
crowd, Ned,” added Dan as he glanced at the great
gathering.</p>

<p>“Five thousand,” responded Ned as he too
scanned the crowded seats.</p>

<p>“Not so many as that,” laughed Dan. “Enough,
though.”</p>

<p>“Make you nervous?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. Can’t tell what the effect will be
later.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Dan,” said Ned cheerily, as
he once more patted his friend on the shoulder.
“You don’t lose your head.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to to-day——”</p>

<p>Dan stopped abruptly as a treble call, “Dan!
Dan!” came from the bleachers not far away. Both
Ned and the young pitcher glanced in the direction
from which the hail had come and saw little Carlton
Hall standing erect and waving his cap frantically
as he called the name of his hero.</p>

<p>“What does he want?” said Ned. “Has he
heard of more ipecac they’re to feed you?”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Dan. “He just can’t contain
himself, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>When at last the game began people were standing
several deep behind the seats. On the field back
of the ropes the ground was covered with spectators
almost as excited as the young players.</p>

<p>“Come here, Dan,” called Ned as he beckoned
to his pitcher. Near Ned were the two umpires
and the captain of the academy nine.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” asked Ned. “The crowd
is so big that the umpires suggest that a hit into it
ought to count for only two bases.”</p>

<p>“That’s as fair for one side as the other,” said
Dan simply.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll agree,” said Ned quickly. Before
the game was ended, however, the captain of
the Tait School nine bitterly regretted the assent
which he so readily gave to the suggestion.</p>

<p>Dan now took his position and as he rubbed the
ball in his mitt a final preliminary cheer came from
the supporters of his nine. The young pitcher
fancied that he could discern the shrill treble of
little Carlton Hall in the midst of the shout. Waving
his hand a moment as a token that he had heard
he stepped into his box and delivered the first ball.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the friends of the academy
as the ball struck the batter on the shoulder. Two
or three of his mates gathered about him and
rubbed the injured spot and then the player speedily
took first base.</p>

<p>“Ball!” “Two balls!” “Strike!” “Three
balls!” “Take your base!” called the umpire in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
quick succession to the second batter who faced
Dan. The shouting became a great roar as the
runner on first moved to second base, while his successor
took his place on first.</p>

<p>Two on bases and none out! The loud and continuous
cheering changed to a wild incoherent cry
of glee when the third player to face Dan sent a
slow ball to Walter, which the usually reliable short-stop
first fumbled; then started to throw to third
base, but speedily changing his decision flung it to
first base too late to catch the runner. Meanwhile
the other two players had each advanced a base.</p>

<p>Three on bases and none out! The Tait School
contingent was silent and dazed, but their rivals
were more than atoning. People were standing,
hats were being thrown in the air, and the deafening
shouts were prolonged and continuous.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII<br>
<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dan was motionless a moment as he stood
facing the next batter, whom he knew to be
the heaviest hitter on the opposing nine. It was
plain too, that the crowd also was aware of this
fact, for loud cheers for White rang out as the
batter advanced to the plate. There were repeated
appeals for a “home run” and for the player to
“bring in everybody.” Indeed, in the prevailing
excitement, the call did not appear to be unreasonable.
White showed plainly that he was prepared
to do his utmost and a moment of weakness on the
part of the pitcher would be fatal.</p>

<p>The wild shouts of the spectators sounded in
Dan’s ears as if they were far away. Even the
treble cry that arose alone like a discordant note
from the supporters of the Tait School was not
heeded by the young pitcher. He removed his cap
and wiped his forehead before he stepped into his
box. He saw Ned’s outstretched hands and read
his sign for his best drop. Shaking his head as
a sign that he understood, Dan glanced at the men
on bases. The runner on second was far from his
base and with his arms hanging loose was moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
up and down the line as if he were a jumping-jack
or a figure strung on wires. The runner on first
started as if he were about to speed toward second.
Dan responded by a quick throw to first, which
just failed to catch the nimble runner as he safely
regained his base and immediately began to repeat
his tactics when Dan again prepared to pitch.</p>

<p>This time Dan was not to be diverted, and he
smiled grimly when the umpire called a strike. His
smile deepened when the batter struck viciously at
the next ball and sent a foul far behind Ned.
Two strikes! The Tait School contingent seemed
to regain a brief moment of hope and sent up a
cheer. When White was called out on strikes as the
next ball sped past him, a sharp yell, almost like the
report of a pistol, broke from the excited schoolboys
and the protests of the chagrined batter as he turned
upon the umpire were speedily checked by the calls
of the assembly to “Play ball! Play ball!” Three
men were still on bases and there was only one out.</p>

<p>Again a batter faced Dan and the latter was
quick to see that the player before him was not only
nervous but timid. Suddenly exerting all his
strength the young pitcher sent the ball with terrific
speed across the plate.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called the umpire promptly.</p>

<p>Responding to Ned’s signal for a quick repetition
Dan again shot the ball straight across the plate
and the batter, not fully prepared for the swift
delivery, struck too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>“Strike two!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>A “ball” and a foul followed in quick succession
and then Dan signaled that his favorite ball was to
follow. Lifting high his arms as if he were striving
to gain every ounce of strength he possessed he sent
in the ball in the midst of a silence that was most
eloquent of the deep feeling of the assembly.</p>

<p>The batter, with every nerve tense, braced himself
and swung heavily upon what he believed was
to be another swift ball. So completely was he deceived
by Dan’s delivery that he struck before the
ball reached him—a ball that rose slowly into the
air, then almost seemed to stop and hesitate as it
neared the plate, and then with a sudden drop shot
in toward the batter.</p>

<p>“Three strikes! Striker out!” called the umpire
sharply.</p>

<p>The cheers now were almost as deafening from
the supporters of the Tait School nine as they were
from their opponents. Three men still were on the
bases, but two batters had struck out in quick succession.
Everything now depended upon the next
player to face Dan. Even a single hit would mean
two runs. If Dan could only strike out the fellow
his work would stand almost alone in the history
of the school. Every boy was now watching the
young pitcher. Was he nervous? The wild antics
of the men on the bases redoubled. The runner on
second took an additional lead and acted as if still
more wires had been strung for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>But Dan was not to be diverted. He was deeply
aroused, for he understood better than anyone
the test that was upon him. He resumed his position
in the box, once more looked at the runners,
then ignoring their antics sent the ball in. A report
like the crack of a falling branch followed and a
wild shout went up as the ball was batted far back
into the crowd along the left-field line. The applause
instantly died away when it was seen that
it was a foul. Ned slapped his hands together as he
stooped to face Dan again. A “ball,” “two balls,”
were then called and the wild roar from the assembly
was of the mingled appeals of the rival factions.
“A hit!” “Strike him out!” “Don’t let him get
his base!” were among the frantic appeals of the
excited spectators. Dan was unusually deliberate
now. He looked long at the batter as if once
more he was endeavoring to ascertain just what
his weakness might be. Ned gave the signal for
one of Dan’s swiftest low inshoots. The young
pitcher nodded his head as a token that he understood.
Drawing back his arm he delivered the ball
as Ned had called for it.</p>

<p>“Three balls!” shouted the umpire promptly.
People were standing on the benches now, apparently
the excitement having passed all control.
Parasols and banners were waving, as well as hats
and arms. A scene of almost indescribable confusion
was everywhere manifest.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!” called the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>The noise of the assembly instantly subsided, as
every spectator now watched Dan. “This ball will
tell the story,” was the word heard in low tones on
every side of the field.</p>

<p>Once more Ned gave the signal for Dan’s deceptive
slow ball. Dan agreed and became still more
deliberate in his movements. Amidst the profound
silence that had settled over the field he again
turned slowly and gave the signal for his players
to move a little farther in. Ignoring the clapping of
hands and the renewed antics of the men on the
bases he slowly raised his hands far above his head,
turned swiftly about, and sent in the decisive ball.
To all appearances he had used every muscle in his
lithe body to give speed to the little sphere, but
once more the ball rose slowly, then again almost
seemed to stop as if to tantalize the batter and
shot in swiftly toward the player, who had lunged
heavily and almost swung himself about in his
determination to hit.</p>

<p>Before the umpire could be heard everyone in the
great crowd knew the man was out and that Dan
had performed the almost impossible feat of striking
out three men in succession when the bases were
filled. But if appearances were the measure, Dan
Richards in his quiet way was the least concerned
of all as, ignoring the cheers of the entire assembly,
he walked to the bench.</p>

<p>The Tait School nine, however, failed in their
turn at the bat to do any better or even as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
their opponents had done. The first two players
ignominiously struck out and Dan, in spite of the
loud cheers that greeted him when he walked to the
plate, sent a slowly rolling grounder toward first
base, which the baseman easily secured and touched
out the runner on the line.</p>

<p>Indeed, neither side succeeded in scoring until
the fifth inning. In the four preceding innings the
Tait School boys had made three scattered hits, not
one of which placed a man beyond second base. On
the Military Academy side White, the heaviest
hitter, the second time he came to bat, sent a long
liner over Smith’s head in the outfield, but by a
great throw the runner was held on third and left
there when the next batter struck out and retired
the side.</p>

<p>The noisy demonstrations of the crowd largely
ceased as the game proceeded. The boys were playing
a wonderful game for schoolboys and the opposing
pitchers were doing marvelous work. Dan
had struck out seven and his opponent five when the
fifth inning began.</p>

<p>Walter, the first batter, was struck on the elbow
by a pitched ball. For a moment the pain was
almost unbearable and the lad twisted and writhed
in his suffering, but pluckily refusing to have anyone
run for him he proceeded to his base. On the
first ball pitched he started swiftly for second base
and as he threw himself forward and slid to the bag
a cloud of dust arose that for a moment almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
blinded him. Instantly hearing the coaches call
him to third he arose and dashed for the base
not knowing where the ball was or what had occurred.
Again sliding as he drew near the third-baseman,
who was standing with outstretched hands
he gained the place in safety before the ball, which
had been thrown over the head of the second-baseman,
was returned to third. As Walter was the
fleetest runner on his nine, the chances seemed good
to the friends of the school that a run would be
secured, as only one was out.</p>

<p>When Streator sent a ball between short-stop and
third base Walter dashed home with his run, while
Streator started swiftly to second, but was thrown
out by the catcher. The next batter was retired on
a short infield fly, but the school nine had secured
one run and was leading.</p>

<p>Another run was secured in the following inning
by a hit which was followed by a long drive into
right field by Ned, but he himself was left on third.
At the beginning of the eighth inning the score
stood two to nothing and the Tait School nine were
beginning to be looked upon as the winners of the
game.</p>

<p>In that inning, however, a base on balls, a hit, and
an error by Hodge placed two of the academy
players on bases and as they quickly attempted a
double steal, Ned threw swiftly to Hodge on third
base. A groan arose from the supporters of the
nine when the ball went far over Hodge’s head and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
before he had raced back and secured it both players
had run home and the score was tied!</p>

<p>Again pandemonium seemed to reign among the
spectators. Every play and every player was wildly
cheered, but both nines failed to score in the ninth
inning. The tenth and eleventh innings also failed
to produce a run for either side. In the twelfth,
however, Walter made a hit and again stole second.
Ned came to bat with sturdy determination to do or
die. The first ball proved to be a strike, then a ball
and a strike quickly followed. The next ball he
struck with all his might and sent it swiftly down
the line directly over third base and before the ball
was sent in from left field Walter raced home with
another run.</p>

<p>By one consent the spectators rose as the academy
nine came to bat in the twelfth inning. Every
player was tense and all realized how much depended
upon the efforts of everyone.</p>

<p>A shrill cry of delight when the first man struck
out was followed by a groan when the short fly
of the next batter was squarely muffed by Streator.
The runner started for second on the first ball
pitched, but when Ned’s throw was easily caught
and the runner was out a renewed shout of glee
went up. When the next batter at last struck out
there was a wild scene. Boys and men rushed upon
the field and singing, shouting, dancing in their excitement,
started for Dan. The young pitcher, however,
had fled for the dressing-room and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
nowhere to be seen. It was enough that the game
and the championship had been won.</p>

<p>The following day the nine met to elect a captain
for the following year. When Ned called the meeting
to order and declared nominations to be in
order, there was only one name presented—that of
Dan Richards.</p>

<p>Slowly rising in his seat, Dan said quietly: “I
thank you, fellows, for the honor you have given
me. I didn’t want you to do it. I’ve got enough to
do to try to do my work in the box without the
other. If you are willing I’d rather have you leave
me free. I think Walter would make a good captain.
He made two of the three runs in the last
game——”</p>

<p>A storm of protests arose, which were led by
Walter himself, but all that Dan would agree to
was to wait until fall before he would definitely
decide.</p>

<p>The day after the closing of the school Dan and
Walter were seated together in the train that was
swiftly carrying them to Rodman.</p>

<p>“Walter,” said Dan slowly, when at last the two
boys were near their destination, “I’m not very
much of a talker. I never have said much to you
about what you have done for me——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say a word, Dan,” broke in Walter, his
face flushing. “You’re not the one to talk.”</p>

<p>“Who is, then?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. When I think what a fool I’ve been
and how I treated you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more,” interrupted Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will say more,” protested Walter. “All
the while I was chasing around with Gus Kiggins,
I knew I was a fool. I never believed I could do it,
but I did and there’s no use in trying to deny it.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t do anything to me.”</p>

<p>“Then it wasn’t because I didn’t try. But I’ve
got a new start now. I wrote my father so the
other day. I told him too, all about you and that
if it hadn’t been for you I’d have gone all the way
with Gus.”</p>

<p>“For me? Why, I haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t do so much, Dan. It was what you
were that made me feel like a goat all the time.”</p>

<p>Dan was silent a moment before he said quietly:
“It has been the greatest year of my life. I can’t
understand, though, why all the fellows have treated
me as they have.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” laughed Walter. “Well, I can.
Say, Dan, that new league is a great success, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Wait till we get the track and the football going,
as we shall next year! You’re going in for the
eleven, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Samson wants me to.”</p>

<p>“So do we all. It will be greater next year than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
it was this, though I hope never to see another
such game as that with the academy nine. You
struck out fifteen.”</p>

<p>“There’s Si waiting for us on the platform,” suddenly
suggested Dan, as the boys obtained a glimpse
of the Rodman station.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he has heard of that game,
Dan?” laughed Walter.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” replied Dan with a smile as
he stepped out upon the platform, where the outstretched
hand of the harness-maker grasped his
first of all.</p>

<p>“I say, Dan,” demanded Silas, “I hear ye beat
’em all.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did! Have the New Yorks said anything
to you yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” laughed Dan.</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear of what Dan does next year,”
suggested Walter.</p>
